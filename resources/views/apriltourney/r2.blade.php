        <p>Perspective difficulties aside I think the composition is pretty cool and more thought out in general this week. The sky gradient is really nice, love the colours, and things feel more 3D, less flat and static. Fixing the perspective stuff is an obvious to-do list item, I also think some more attention to materials would be good. Statues, pillars, stairways and floors are usually made from different kinds of stone and they have their own warmth, grain, texture etc. Even texturing just the ground plane here would help with the perspective a little I think, smooth gradients don't show things as well. I like how this idea has a better sense of movement going on too, something actually happening, a cheeky lil bit of story. </p>

        <p>Sense of scale in this one is noice, good use of camera angle to show it. It's unfinished ofc which is a shame but the colours and textures are still really nice, and there's so much potential for different kinds of rendering with the moss vs pillars, statue etc that I think finished up it'd look great, there's a bit more thinking about the background in general this week which is great. The hatching to show the lighting is well done too. Colours overall are pretty similar, I'd maybe change the colour or material of the pillars to make them clearly different from the statue guy.  PLEASE don't leave things to last minute this weekend, I love seeing your more polished stuff. </p>

        <p> Composition is less ambitious or complicated than last week but still looks nice, really good overall shapes which I like. I think you could push the values more, statues tend to have strong shadow shapes especially in the folds of drapery etc, and some rim lighting on the wings could look good too. Your rendering is really nice, all the hue changes especially look great, stone can be really beautiful when you notice all the hue shifts in it. I feel like more different kinds of edges would help this piece (lost/soft/hard/sharp/etc) but it looks like you ran out of time. Really solid work here though, shame the deadline is so short for these things tbh, I asked last week to see more rendering skill on display and I'm definitely impressed.  </p>

        <p> Glad you had fun, there's nothing wrong with being a bit self indulgent. I think the composition is a little cramped for space overall, with the statues being pretty close to the edges of the canvas. Values are most important thing with this one I think though, the background castle and sky have nice colours but are too close in value and blend into each other a bit. Some darker cast shadows on the castle would help separate things, or a more obvious gradient on the sky and clouds. I also think the statues themselves are pretty low contrast and lose some readability from that. If you keep them on a different layer then you can adjust the curves or brightness/contrast later in the process and see what works better. Readability is always key for full illustrations. The child also looks pretty flat, the idea of them interacting is sweet though. </p>

        <p> The values and rendering in general are better, good idea to keep things simpler so you had more time for things like that. I think we could see a little more of the face on the right though, and the background doesn't help much with the composition. Maybe a darker background would be a good idea to separate things a little, or better yet some kind of diagonal to lead our eyes back in to the faces; shadows being cast from other buildings or something are good for this. I like the idea having us more in an actual scene, it feels more intimate and like a snapshot of something going on which always helps with story, it's not just a static full body thing. Thinking about materials would really help though imo, the smooth but hard stone of a statues face would contrast really nicely with the softer folds of a hoodie, I think pushing that aspect and how they differ from each other would help sell the idea. It's also a good idea to have her more rendered than the rest of the piece since she seems to be the focal point. </p>

        <p> Really ambitious to have the horse interacting with the car, those are two subjects people really struggle to get right in perspective so good job. I like some of the details too like how sharp the breaking glass looks and the crumpling metal roof. Colours overall work together but things are pretty light value across the board, remember to use different values as things go into the background to help separate fore/middle/background. You chose an awkward angle for the horse too I think, if our camera was a bit further down and to the left, looking up at the horse slightly and more from it's side, I think it'd look better, read better, and also emphasise the scale. Because he's a bigass stone horse crushing a puny car and emphasising that is good. Might also help with the values, since more of his side would be in shadow and the streetlights would be blocked more by him. I think you did pretty well considering how late you left things (tut tut), I wish I could see more information in the background though, what the other statues are doing especially I feel like would give some more story.  </p>

        <p> I really like the spooky/uncanny vibes from this, and you consciously planning that with the doll like faces or making them unnaturally large is great. The pointillism kind of rendering is pretty cool and works well with those spooky vibes. Normally I'd say the values are a bit limited, having the human man a different shade to the stone figures would help, or the figure at the back being another value, but I don't know how doable that is with this method of painting. Composition is ok but I'd like to see more attention towards the sculptor maybe, perhaps zooming out a bit to emphasise the size difference and also show how lonely he is? I don't know if he was a lonely man but falling in love with statues makes me think so. Seeing multiple statues and from different angles is really nice.  </p>

        <p> I think you've worked more from bigger to smaller shapes this time and it's definitely helped. The values and lighting are pretty nice too, and the feeling of scale and of things reaching out towards us is pretty nice too. I don't have much to say on composition but I like there being some diagonals, like we're not directly in front of the wall but to the side, that looks much better than the alternative. I think some more detail or something on the hand reaching towards us might be good though, or making it catch the light, something to help clearly separate it from the face further. Good attention to the warmer tones of the marble too, though right now the hands and head are pretty different from each other. I'd like to see even more attention to material and also to edges. The rendering on this one is better than prompt 1 I think, and some soft, hard, lost, sharp etc edges would help bring things even higher for sure.  </p>

        <p> I recognise that statue, nice idea and I like it having a clear story with the multiple panels. Didn't make me die much inside, sorry. I think the colours are better this week, they feel more vibrant I guess, and the purple in the background and the reflective shine on Ronald's suit are great. Pussy placement feels a bit weird to me, should be more beneath the pelvis not as on the front if that makes sense. The boobs and faces are a step up from last week's too actually, I don't know if you just had more time to work with or what but I can see definite improvements. My main issue is I think the lower panel could be a bit less cropped, like at the moment it's pretty letterbox and if it was more of a landscape you'd have more space to work with, show a little more of the statue and that she's kneeling in front of it, just to make it a little more instantly obvious. Really great work though, I look forward to seeing what you come up with for the final prompt.  </p>

        <p> There's a clearer sense of perspective and forms this week, well done. Us being able to see the plinth and ground plane really helps I think. I like the attention to detail with the hair rendering, though I feel like you don't have to always show every strand with things like that. Learning how to imply is sometimes better, lets our eye do more of the work and makes the canvas less busy. Your anatomy needs some work but I get a sense of weight which is good, and he feels like a 3D figure in space, which might be better than having flawless anatomy but it feeling totally flat. The colour on the rope barriers is really quite faint though, maybe try using a different medium like some pens, or go over it again so that it's more readable. I think you used reference which is good but you could do with paying attention to it some more, especially with areas like the feet, hands, or the shoulder/armpit. I think it's a good improvement since last week's prompt though, good job. </p>

        <p> It's difficult for me to score more stylised stuff but I like things overall, really like how you focused on the scale of this giant statue. I feel like the schoolgirl is a little close to the edge of the canvas and some of the background trees, could be nudged a bit more central maybe. The colours are nice but there's so much blue, I feel like making the dragon more obviously golden would compliment things and make it more interesting too. I really like the line around the shadow shapes though, especially on the folds on her white shirt, looks really nice. Her hair doesnt have much contrast with the shading actually, reads more as just one big shape, maybe some highlights or making it a little more contrasting would be better. I think things could read a little better with some adjustments mainly, we have to remember that most people are going to see stuff as a small thumbnail on their phone while scrolling. </p>

        <p> The composition overall isn't as well planned as last week, with the full background and everything you had, but I think it still works nicely. Having the characters interacting with each other helps a lot. The idea of them changing to more modern equipment is pretty cool too. The rendering is pretty nice, having each of them be a different material especially looks good, though I think the gold one would be shinier and they tend to be way more reflective too. I was going to do a gold statue for this challenge too but decided against being so masochistic. Making their values all work together with the different materials is hard, the dark material absorbs so much light and the gold reflects so much, so well done making them all stay readable. I wish there was some kind of background or that we could see more of their bodies though.  </p>

        <p> Much better display of perspective skills this week, I remember that was something that couldve been better with the background castle last time. The overall idea is very comfy, and I like all the little interactions going on. The colours are pleasant too, but I think things are too bright overall. The shadows and shading aren't very noticable and it's a bit washed out looking because of the light values all over. Even separating some of the fore/middle/back ground elements with value might help, like making the statue closest to us more rendered, maybe making the environment outside a little darker etc. I love the shriney pictures too god bless. The horse is definitely cute but he's quite small all the way in the back there, I don't know how much attention you wanted to give him but I feel like he could have more.  </p>

        <p> There's some definite improvements from last week, I like how the composition is less cramped, better planned and everything is more readable. The lava, rock and sky colours all work together well which is good, they all feel like the same environment. This doesn't carry over to the dragons atm though, their cool grey is too different for them to feel like they're really there. Maybe you ran out of time to start painting them so this is just the lay in, but I think even brushing over them with a low opacity overlay layer or something to get their colours closer to the rest of the painting would have helped them feel more present and 3D. I definitely like the story to the idea, and having the dragons interacting with each other and the scientists there reacting to them is a great idea. I feel like you shouldnt be afraid to use harder edges more, especially with rock and scales they're pretty important, but the main issue with the piece is the dragons not being properly grounded in their surroundings like I mentioned before.  </p>

        <p> It's nice to see this one painted, I think the shadows on statues are super important for showing what they're like so it's a better move than just lines. Really nice work on the lighting, especially on that tummy and the softer shadow shapes on Medusa. Things seem pretty unfinished overall though, and I feel like the colours and values are a bit close to each other overall, even changing the background to a gradient or some more different hue would help. The colours in the rendering are lovely, I like the blues vs warmer greys a lot, just overall the piece could use more variation. Medusa dealing with the same curse in modern times is a cool idea, makes me wonder what other punishments of the gods would still hold up today.  </p>

        <p> I like that this one has some more feeling of depth and good movement too, the dragon winding around the pillars is great for that. Great detail on him too, I like the face especially. I feel like the girl could be better separated from the background though, maybe having another darker window/doorway on the wall in front of her would have helped with that. Your attention feels a little widely spread in general, like the dragon is so nicely done with well thought out shading and lines, but the back wall and the girl are much looser and somewhat haphazard. Maybe you ran out of time or sunk it all into the dragon, if you could spread it more evenly netx time though I think that'd be even better than this round.  </p>

        <p> Great idea, I love how you kept the poses so similar to the statues. The colours are great and I like the soft gradients in the shadows too. It's a shame we can't see more of the flowing grass though, I feel like you could have changed up the background a bit so we had more of that and make the hedge or wall a little smaller. That's mostly personal preference though. I think the folds of the shirts could be better too, right now they don't have much weight to them and thats a little thing that I think could make things better. Values overall might be a bit jumbled too, having the brightly lit boomer against the bright sky, the grass and even the front of the mower and snake are all lit brightly too. Some darker shadows or tones down values here or there might help.  </p>

        <p> The perspective on this one seems more solid, and I like how you kept things pretty clean too, it's more organised. I think the red is pretty strong in comparison to the rest, maybe could tone that down a bit. It's good that you stopped to protect your arm, I wonder what you would have prioritised if you had kept going? I like the statues themselves but feel like they're not that grounded in the environment other than the dragon, who's actually interacting with it a bit. Something to think about next time.  </p>

        <p> Much better work this week, well done. The statue is the best bit imo, I like the shading and the slightly heavier line weight for the outline, very nice. Using all one medium makes things look better too, no more harshly different ink shadows. The perspective feels a bit weird, but the floor being that checkered pattern really helps overall I think, last week's ground plane was pretty empty I remember. The other figure needs some work, their proportions first and foremost since they have a very small head, hands etc in comparison to the rest of their body. I like the ray of light onto the statue idea, but I'm not sure it works how you've done it. Maybe having it entirely white with a couple of like directional streaks would work better? It's difficult to show light rays like that on a mostly white page though and it still comes across like this.  </p>

        <p> I like there being more of a defined fore/middle/background separation this week, and the sense of scale of the sphinx is cool. I didn't even consider it to be a statue it's so big and ancient so good idea. Right now there's some gradient on the sphinx's body, front legs being lighter, but I feel like more of that would be good. The sphinx irl has a great texture and layers to it's body especially and then a smoother more hard edged head. Having texure detail like that on something huge can also really help sell the scale, like having all those tiny towers on a star destroyer or the death star, without them they're just a big single shape. "Greeble" is the phrase for it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble I think you couldve been a little more adventurous with the cast shadows from the sphinx too, it's so big and in typically bright daylight, so would cast good shapes much like a building does. Big shadows being cast also really help with scale, you see artists like Sparth use that trick all the time to make it seem like there's something huge just off screen. And I'm glad painting's becoming easier, keep going! </p>

        <p> This is GREAT, I like all sorts of things about it. The story behind it is nice and the characters have a lot of life and for lack of a better word character to them. There's a lot of design in the room and all the props too, and I love the texture and things like dust catching the light, and the rays through the boarded up window. Great colours overall too, the strong orange edge around the light from the doorway is delicious. For my crits, I would say it's minor value things mostly. I feel like the girl could stand out from the background a little more, maybe a little darker outline to the dress or her darkest darks in general. Likewise the back wall of the room and some of the fabric the rhino is hiding under could be darker too, the bottom right but won't be getting much light since he's blocking most of it. Some of the graffiti is difficult to read too, the "I need more time" (kek) one especially. Really really lovely work overall though, the little details like the holes in the blanket, little hue shifts on the wall or nice bits of texture are all great, super well done. </p>

        <p> I like this composition and idea more than last weeks for sure, the separation of the background is really nice and the colours and values all work to help things. You've got more variety of edges this time too including some SHARPS for the scalpel which is perfect. The different hues on the clay are also really nice, I think you could make the blue in the shadows a fraction stronger though. My main crit this time is on rendering more on the focal points. Really getting into detail with the hands and the most important parts of the face would make things even better imo, I feel an urge to go in and start doing it myself, this piece has really solid potential, and putting a bit more time into the most important points could bring more of that out. So detail prioritisation I guess is what you'd call it. The sculptors skin tone is a bit off too tbh, it depends on the lighting ofc but you could make them a bit warmer and more varied hues in there. Great improvement from the first round though, especially if this took a similar amount of time, keep it up! </p>

        <p> Even if things didn't speak to you this is a nice idea. I definitely like the thickness (sweatingman) and theres some nice details like the texture on the statue contrasting with the smooth soft skin of the girl etc. My main issue is with colours and value overall, the whole piece is pretty bright, and even bright daylight on a beach means some solid shadows happening. It's pretty hard to see some things like the blush lines too. More hue variation in general would be nice too, skin is great for having all these different colours in it as you go around the form and I think it'd help some of the areas which feel a bit flat right now, like the girls arms and hair. You say you know everything that's wrong so just focus on fixing those things for the next prompt. The ideal is something that's not just good but that YOU are happy with.   </p>

        <p> I'm glad you found time to polish things up more even if it's not totally finished. Great idea and you portrayed it nicely, having him coming out of the wall is super cool and makes it feel like a key part of an animated movie. The gleam of the gold is really nice, his materials in general are, and I like the shadow he's casting too. Having the shadow sharper near his body and then getting softer edges as it gets further away would be good though, helps with scale too. I know you ran out of time but I'll offer up some crits either way, I feel like you could go more wild with the colours overall, aztec stuff is great for a wide variety of colours. Texture on the wall is nice but more would be nicer, I want to see this dusty old wall blending into this gleaming vibrant serpent, like contrasting one thing with another is a joy for the eyes, whether it's hard/soft, light/dark, rough/smooth. It shouldnt be so harsh it distracts us or anything but that balance is really enjoyable to drink in, idk. Mullins talks about it a lot, everything is about balanced contrast. I hope you get more time to play with for the next round, with some more time for rendering things up this would be top tier stuff.  </p>

        <p> What a sweet idea, the origami birds and her sheltering them is lovely. The rendering on the wings and the lighting on the statue in general is really nice too. I think the piece feels quite flat overall though, Mainly from seeing the corner of the building straight on like this, it really turns it into a 2D shape rather than a 3D one. If we saw more of another side, be that the right side or top, that'd help a lot I think. The things in front of and behind it are pretty basic too, like we need some kind of connection between the fore/middle/backgrounds or they risk feeling like 2D panels in front of each other yknow. That's why so many environment pieces have paths or rivers going through them, it doesnt just lead the eye it makes it all one 3D thing. The clouds and rain are pretty simple too, making the rain a little more random and less uniform would help with that I think. The burger is a nice idea too but it's a pretty bright saturated colour and so doesn't feel as real as the statue is, like it's not inhabiting the same space. The birds manage to be bright too but arent as jarring, like they're affected by the lighting more. Maybe you ran out of time for rendering, idk. Some of the details are really nice though, like the cracks and texture in the building and statue are great, though her face feels a little painted on rather than carved in, it depends on the statue but some clearer cut shadow shapes around the eye and nose area would make it feel more like a chiselled out face I think. </p>

        <p> Great work managing to keep the values mostly balanced overall, though I think the red shape on the right is a little stronger than it should be, Personally I'd make the more important foreground stuff a bit stronger/darker too, at the moment the statue is really close to the backdrop. I like having the multiple people interacting, that always helps to make things more interesting story wise plus makes them all feel grounded together in the environment. The depth is quite nice but I think some more things between us and the background might help even more. I really like the main character and the statue, the pink paint isn't very obvious at first though, maybe make the contrast between that and the stone a bit clearer. This piece feels more ambitious in the composition than the first ones, especially with all these figures and the environment, good job. I think value management and making sure things read well from a thumbnail should be your main focuses for the next round, to make things even better. </p>

        <p> Things usually look better in thumbnails lad, just how it goes. You did well to get it to this stage since you said you started pretty late and were ambitious. I like the depth in this one much more, the city itself could be a bit more rendered so we can tell which buildings are closer vs further from us, but things work overall. The gargoyle is pretty cool though I'm not sure if he has only one wing or if the other is hidden behind the first, it looks a bit odd to me. The subtle lighting on him is really nice though, it's pretty tough to get values right for nighttime scenes. Some more finish on the gargoyle would have been nice since he's so much closer to the camera and is the clear unopposed focal point, and like I said some more work to show the depth of the overall city would have been nicer too, but I think this is a step up from last week's either way, good job.  </p>

        <p> I feel like the statue could be more active, like interacting with a person somehow or in the process of standing up or moving, something like that would make things more interesting. The sense of scale is nice overall, and the statue is very central which is nice, the perspective on the things around him though feels weird, like things are warped. It's not easily readable where the cliffs start and stop, or are straight vs curving, I think readability like that is super important. Nice colours and values though and I like how he's so tall his head is catching more of the light than other parts of the painting. This was also a super ambitious piece for a small deadline so you did well to get this much painted tbh. Also the digital overall looks better than your ink stuff last week, you balanced the shadows better so they're not a bit overpowering like before. Some more texture would be nice but no way you'd have time to do all of it, maybe just on the statue himself.  </p>

        <p> The details of the gold are really nice, and the materials in general feel great. I especially like the thick folds of the fabric on the ground, they're like a mix between stone and cloth, can feel how heavy it is. The slightly different feels of the polished stone of the statues skin vs the cloth is really nice too, helps separate them a bit, really nice rendering. I like the overall contrast of the figures but I feel like you couldve gone stronger with some of the shadows, some parts like where the hair meets the face could really use some more definition. The poses are great but I think the canvas is a bit too cropped, extending it out to the left and top a little would help things feel less cramped for space. The background is also pretty plain, even a more obvious gradient to it or some hue variation would be a bit more interesting. Your creativity level dropped a bit not because I think it's a bad idea or anything, just that having all the different story elements framed in one interior type thing you did for the first prompt was really amazing. This week is good but more straight forward, thats why the score changed like that. </p>

        <p> The different hues on the statue are really nice, helps sell the material well. The tortoise could do with some separation though, maybe a slightly different kind of stone or something so they're clearly two different things would be good. I like the story to this piece too, having things be in motion of a key part of things happening is great, always makes things more interesting. Values and composition read much better than last weeks piece, I feel like the back wall needs pushed back a bit more though. You could either make it a little lighter or the statue a bit darker, or another thing that would help is some kind of helpful texture to the floor. Someone else used tiles on their floor this week to sell the perspective easily, other people had floorboards etc. Just something to make the distance and perspective a little easier to read. I'd like to see some more shadows on the statue himself too, you have some in places like the deeper folds of the cloak, some more like that under the rim of the helmet or around the waist would look good. There's some nice difference in edges in the rendering but think about how with some materials you can push that even more, like statues are fantastic for hard edges contrasting with very soft ones. Colours are pretty nice overall, but the woman's dress blends into the floor a lot, changing the value or just the colour entirely would be a good idea.  </p>

        <p> I like having the living statue in such a normal every day situation, it's a nice blend of the magical and the normal. This piece is definitely better value wise I think than the first prompt, it's not washed out at all this time which is great. The colours on the statue itself are especially nice and rich. I like the scale and depth that this perspective gives, there's a few issues here and there with it but it's pretty cool overall. I think more of a reaction/interaction between the person closest to the camera and the statue would be good, right now it's like he's ignoring the statue. I think you could have some darker shadows here and there too like in the arch/doorway on the left. More attention to material would be nice too if you have enough time, the statue's different stones and scales look great, the same kind of thing making hair different from cloth and stone would help things look nicer I think. It's a balancing act though, too much detailing will start distracting and making everything too busy. </p>

        <p> I LOVE this one. Things read a bit clearer than last weeks, helped by a bit more separation between props and things like the more obvious outline round the statue. The warped perspective thing of the cafe is really nice, really well thought out composition overall. My minor issues with it are that the materials could feel a little better, like the girls hair could be a little more layered and fluffy feeling, and while the statue feels like gold, the legs feel more like soft clay than hard stone. That might be deliberate though, I don't know what the statue's made of. Similarly the floorboards are great but I'm not sure what the tables are made of yknow.The attention to detail on all the foods is super nice, some of the lighter ones like the furthest left cake are a bit close in value to the background though, I don't know if you should make the background behind them a little darker or make the food a little stronger colours, but a bit more contrast between the two would be good. Excellent piece overall though, it's amazing you got all this done so quickly too, make sure you don't hurt your arm or anything. </p>

        <p> There's definitely more feeling of foreground/background depth this time. I like how it doesnt feel too staged either, the two people are just going about their day doing their thing which is nice. Jimi being lit while they're not is really nice too. The colours and rendering on the statue could be better though, he feels pretty unfinished right now. The background too could be more interesting, even if it was just a store front or a basic street or something. I want to say more information on clothing folds for the two people would be better, but I wouldn't want things to distract from the statue, so you'd have to keep it balanced. Focal point should have the most information and interest. It's a slight step up from last week I think, I'd like to see even more thinking about location and stuff though, like where they are, what time of day it is so you know what the light is like, etc.</p>

        <p> Love the use of the shade from the tree over the statue, looks really nice. Piece looks very nice overall, my suggestions are mostly minor. The burger, fries etc are pretty small and unobtrusive, maybe make them catch a little more of our attention. I really like the dappled effect and texture to the grass in the shade of the tree, the tree itself could use some more of that though, right now it's pretty flat and I think should be darker in general. The statues look great with their waterstains and texturey weathered feel, I just wish the tree had more of that kind of treatment. Great work with the watercolours and using just enough of an outline to make things read well, good job.  </p>

        <p> Pretty abstract overall which is cool, I already mentioned the vaporwave vibes in the discord which personally I like. The values are a bit high all over though which makes things a bit washed out, having things lower value in general would mean the plastic bag and knife would be easier to make stand out. If your average value is too high then it's like you hit the purest white ceiling too soon and can't push things as much as you want to yknow. I really like the rendering on the statues, the taiji taomote one particularly has some nice edges and hues. It's ok if you ran out of time, might have put a bit too many things in this week. To do all that drapery on the statues, bag, figure etc would take forever and we just didn't have enough time to work with. A bit more realistic planning at the thumbnail stage might be good for next prompt then, to make sure you don't have way too much work to do, and also making sure the overall value ranges are balanced, leaving you enough room for those lightest lights and darkest darks at the end.  </p>

        <p> Really like the pose of the statue, even without arms or a head it reads well. The composition works ok but things are super simple this round, even having some grass texture or more shadows, maybe the white lines on the pitch to show us some more perspective etc would make things more interesting. Rendering on the statue is great especially on the wings, those shadows seem darker than other ones in the piece though, either lightening them up a little or adding more shadows in general like I already said would even things out a bit. The other figures just don't feel as finished as the statue does, even things like how the shirt is rendered out more. It's pretty dynamic and I like the idea a lot, but it feels like more time needs put into it, and background etc doesnt need to be quite so simple.  </p>

        <p> Sorry to hear about your distractions and problems going on outside of the painting itself. It's good that you find watercolours more relaxing though, hope to see more of them from you in future then. This piece feels a bit flatter than the one last week, the foreground and background and clearly separated at least (good work with the slight outline on the dress to help with this) but there's not much between them or between us and them. I feel like you could have some of the waves closer than others, and have some of the fabric wrapping around the body more obviously, give it some extra weight and form even if those statues are always super flowy. The shadows in them are really important to show how things are folding. I like the colours a lot though, the sea has some nice hue variation going on especially. I wonder if more of a gradient on the sky would be good too, something to make it more 3D than just a pretty flat colour. I hope things go better next week without the distractions and loss of motivation!  </p>

        <p> I refuse to skip. I think the idea is cool, having all those people is pretty ambitious and time consuming though. You have to think about how much time you have to work with while you come up with ideas, learning to pace things right is a useful skill. The perspective is way better this week though, and the buildings and people give us a good sense of scale and where the camera is which I like. Time management is most important thing right now tbh, even having a bit of time to shade in the buildings might have helped a lot. The horse and figure actually look pretty good, the smoke or whatever around them not so much. Having the buildings shaded in would have let you have the smoke as white, in front of dark which I think would look and read better. Maybe think about values a bit next time, like if you wanted the horse and rider darker or lighter than the background buildings etc. And again time management, I hope you have more time to play with for the next prompt. </p>
