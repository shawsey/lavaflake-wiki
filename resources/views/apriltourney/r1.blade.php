        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The composition has a good idea behind it but feels lacking overall. It's a bit empty, and the depth of foreground/middleground.background could be designed better. The spiked peaks help with this and with leading the eye though. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - I like the colours, especially the green glow, and how the figure on their steed adds some story and direction to things. Well done for trying environments and I'm glad you've learned from this. Some things to focus on would be how the architecture feels very flat and 2D, there's also little depth to how the hill changes behind it. There are strange edges too, the spikes jutting out of the ground being sharp makes sense, but the rest of the snow would be much softer, and if you had used soft vs hard edges to show shadows being cast over the dunes, between the figure and the building, it could have really helped. Snow and ice are extremely difficult though. The figure is a little close in value and colour to their steed too, maybe some of the green light glow hitting them would help with separating them a little. I would have liked to see something more done with the sky too, arctic skies and aurora borealis feel huge and that could have helped push the feeling of depth, going away behind the architecture to the horizon. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - You said yourself that it's not super original, I hope next weekend you do more thumbnails and find more interesting ways to show things. I feel like you lost some of the atmopshere and scale from your wip/sketch stage too.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your skill with digital isn't really the issue here. That said, better application of when to make things sharp or not would help your work a lot I think. </p>

        <p> Rule of thirds, basic overlapping (that unfortunately causes tangents), and use of shapes to lead the eye to the PoI. Poor use of size and placement of forms to indicate perspective. No use of atmospheric perspective. Poorly established light sources – a bit of rim light, and a strange global light, the aurora sheds no light on the landscape. The green aurora indicates an exciting colorful idea, but the rest of the palette cuts it short. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - The composition is really good, but its a bit barren. I guess thats the point, but maybe having a path leading up to the castle, some more decoratons on said path would have gone a long way to fleshing this out more. still, theres nothing negative to save about this beyond that.  The castle and Aurora are great, they stand out as this sort of otherworldly structure in an otherwise barren wasteland and dominates the scene without it being overly distracting to the rest of the piece.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - Yhe colours are just a tad bit saturated for my liking. the blue hues in the sky are a great touch, but they are a bit too intense. more than that, the weird sort of stretched effect you have on the ice and snow is great, It feels like its all packed and solid, but the lines have been pulled along by harsh winds over the years and it works very well, but the effect should really be less noticable at a distance. The lake in the background is great, but the long, distinct streaks make it look like its a lot closer and smaller than it really should be. You dont need me to tell you this but details like that should ideally get become more vague as they get further away. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - Red riding hood making her way to an icy castle is an interesting take on the story. I assume its red riding hood anyway, theres not much to indiciate otherwise. It feels like shes getting ready to take on the castle itself, like its housing some kind of final boss. Its just cool. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - Just fix up the concentration of details in your enviroments and you are golden.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - There's a clear feeling of story here, and things are designed well so that the eye is led straight to the focal point of the piece. Space could be utilised a little better though I think, for example the space between the main characters and the foreground crowd, or between them and the background. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - The character designs are fantastic, as is the strong choice of light sources and the colours. If you had had more time or polished things more, some textures would have helped I think, the differences between the robes and fur and the rougher stone floor would be nice. The background and foreground being more fleshed out and possibly darker would help sell the whole thing more too.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The characters and focal point are great and your unique ideas are on display, other parts are less concrete though, for example the background feels placeholder. I don't know if you just ran out of time or if you didn't have a solid idea of what to do with it yet, but that brings the piece down a little.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - Your idea comes across well and you made good use of softer and harder brushes especially for where the light hits surfaces. I think some more use of texture would be the only thing I'd suggest, even if it's just on the stone floor and so on. </p>

        <p>An appealing palette (varied and still unified). Lovely gestures and expressively stylized characterizations. Clearly defined light sources. Good preliminary work with light and shadow shapes. Minor issues with composition – capped corner, skimmed edges, and a little wonky perspective setup (but would probbaly settle down if more time was spent). The piece points to a highly finished end product, and the biggest issue seems to be a lack of judgement regarding scope and time in relation to the artist's level of proficiency.

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - The composition design is really nice and well thought out, even down to the snakes. I'm curious what the depth would be like when finished, and just what the side panels would look like. Overall this looks great though, clearly had thought put into it. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - Difficult to estimate when it's still a work in progress, but there's clear attention to the different textures of fur/hair vs fabric or snake skin, and things like the hands and the folds of the robes are nicely done. The faces seem quite placeholder right now though and since people will usually look at faces first that's something that brought the score down. I'd like to have seen how you did the rest of the piece and what it would look like fully painted.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The overall design is very well thought out, and you decided on things like costume and background too when most people focus on the figure foremost and then make the rest up as they go. I don't know if you thought about colours yet but I would have liked to have seen some of those too.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You have a good grasp of the digital medium, I can't tell how good you are at painting and polishing things up from a WIP like this though. </p>

        <p> It's clear to see Chooby has spent a lot of time doing digital painting. His sense of form and colour is lovely and you can feel motion in the drapery of the clothes and the water. The subsurface scattering on the belly of the horse and its face is exceptionally well done, and immidiately conveys that this is no ordinary horse but something magical to the viewer. The composition suffers mostly from a lack of clear direction and well-distributed values. The cut of the canvas strikrd me as off as well. Some more planning during the sketching phase would benefit Chooby greatly, as there are some easy to fix perspective issues happening in the frame as well as doing more thumbnails to play around with different elements in his composition. The base composition is interesting but there seems to be some confusion regarding element hierarchy. One thing that seems to flatten the image is the same treatment across the board (the only exception being the horse's head). Keeping your background rough is okay, but you should be polishing your focal points more.
        Chooby's usage of colour here is competent but I'd encourage looking at references while working. Though the moon makes us believe this scene is taking place during the night the washed out white light is far too harsh, making the viewer feel like there's an arena spotlight lighting up the water. Huge pity because the much weaker moonlight compared with the dark water would have been an excellent opportunity to tie in the female figure interacting with the horse more as she could be lit by the secondary green lightsource being emited from the kelpie. An excellent effort by Chooby overall, and he ought to be proud of himself. Excited to see what he has in store next! </p>

        <p>A creative and original concept. Contrast in value and saturation enforce the PoI. The brush work is quite muddled, and there's only a slight material indication and designing done to convey the concept. The light source is poorly established. Little use of atmospheric perspective.

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Nothing feels wasted, and nothing feels like its been addded in arbitrarily either. shits good. but everything is just a bit too hazy.  i cant really fault you for that though because you shouldn't pull a 5lip and give yourself carpal tunnel. Though, a few more waves here or there wouldnt have been misplaced.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - the hair is actually pretty impressive, the waxy brushwork makes the kelpies hair look as drenched as seaweed. the girls hair is similarly good. You just needed to spend more time on all the other stuff to clean it up, because the afformentioned haziness does bring it down a bit. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The overall idea is very nice and goes well with the Swan Lake aesthetic. It could use some work though, the guy's foot is at the very edge of the canvas, and though I can see some hints of a tower or something in the right hand frame/window, it's almost totally covered by the dancer and her skirt. I feel like the black swan's arm placement could be better too, she covers most of the guy's face and the hand lines up a bit closely with the edge of the frame. Minor things but I think they could make the piece better if solved.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The colours and overall values of the piece are good, but things are clearly unfinished and this brings some things down. The grass, flowers etc in particular could have used some more attention, and I think the dancers have a lot of potential if they and their costumes were polished up more. I also think a more obvious colour difference between the black and white swan's backgrounds could help sell the idea better.   </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - I like the idea of the piece but it feels lacking, I think you could be more adventurous with your decisions on things like background and lighting. I would have liked to see more thought put into the garden and things around them.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You know what you're doing with the materials, I think the frames and the swans especially are nicely done. I can't see how you would handle different textures and rendering with this piece as it is though.  </p>

        <p> A pleasant color palette and an ambitious concept. Depicting figures in dynamic motion and interacting with each other is a tough challenge for any artist of intermediate skill. The effort shines through and the line work is quite confident, but it runs into problems regarding anatomy and perspective: mainly proportions and foreshortening. Simplification and stylization is employed with confidence but not experience. The rendering is mostly flat, and although the composition has a nice decorative setup, it suffers from tangents. The piece points to a more finished end product, but a lack of judgement regarding scope and time in relation to the artist's level of proficiency seems to be an issue.

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - this is a bit hard to score because i understand what you were aiming for with this, but what you ended up with looks more like 2 different pictures just slapped together right next to eachother. the colours are nice though and work well to seperate the characters from eachother. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - you know some anatomy, your knowledge on the subject is a bit shakey. one example of this is the black swans clavicle. Each clavicle moves indpendentaly from one anaother, so you dont have to raise them both when one arm is rasied. The legs are also just sort of lumpy? i dont really know how else to describe them, so we'll go with that. Ballet dancers are a good subject to learn anatomy and gesture with because they expose your weaknesses in those subject in a very obvious manner, this means however that everyone can see those flaws. Regarding the background and colours, its nice. simple bit effective. The what the mirrors/gates/murals are similary effective, just being lit from underneath makes them feel a lot more complete.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - the problem is that it just doesnt really work. its a clunky composition that needed to be refeined more. i would have done it by going for a more abstract presentation, leaning into the whole mural idea you have going. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - nothing you did stands out as being obviously your prgram of choice. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - I would have liked to have seen more planning on how to arrange all the princesses together. As it is they don't really inhabit the same space, even something like another one of them leaning on the motorbike or something would have helped with this. The framing overall is quite nice though and they all have a similar colour scheme so they don't clash at all.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - While you have clearly put attention to things like costume design, poses and especially the hair, the piece lacks some other things. I feel like overall it's quite washed out, a better design of values would help with this and stop it all blending together at first glance. Readability is very important. You can use darker or stronger colours and values, confidence to try these things would be good. Some of how the characters overlap brings things down, like top right's knees lining up with the bow and hair of the girl beneath her, or how we can't really see top left's scooter behind the head of the girl beneath her. I feel like you could plan things better in the thumbnail stage for things like this, or even keep each character on a different layer so you can move things around as needed later. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - There is good originality in the poses and designs of each princess and I like this a lot. However you could have been more creative with colour schemes and how they interact with each other, and the background of the piece is left pretty plain. I think you could be more adventurous with your ideas next weekend and that might help, even if you then risk not being able to finish it all in time.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I don't think medium has much of a bearing on your score, though I think using things like the brightness/contrast, or hue saturation settings would help you for next week. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Its a pretty standard ensemble composition, but thats not a bad thing. i can see the begginings of a background, but im unsure if you intended to leave it as is, or you were going to embelish it more like how disney does those murals for the disney princesses. i dont really know, so im going to assume you intended to do more but just didnt get the chance. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - nice pastel colours and some generally good designs. the hair is particularly impressive. gestures are a bit limp though, especially ariel and her weirdly posed wrsits. the outlines are also a bit crusty? chunky? i dont know what to call them, all i know is that the hair is more polished than people the hair is attatched to. The pastel colours, while nice, are overly pale, some shading wouldnt hve been misplaced here.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - okay but which one has heelies?</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 1 - It's hard to critique the composition of such a simple piece with very little in it. Red riding hood is cute, and I can see what you were going for with the bigger wolf, but any kind of depth would be good. It doesn't even need a background, but the characters are cut off by the canvas, I don't know if this is a crop of a larger sketch but it feels like it. Next weekend try doing thumbnails first and make sure you can fit everything in with good space around them.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - I appreciate you putting in some texture of the wolf's fur, and shading the cloak with both soft brush and hatched lines. You could experiment with these methods more and find a way that really works with your way of drawing. There's very little else to the piece though, so I can't talk much about anatomy, perspective, values, etc. If you had at least tried putting these things in it'd be better, as it is I can't say anything about it.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - Red riding hoods design is nice, or what we can see of her at least. The wolf is pretty generic, you could have had a lot of fun with making him look evil or strong or anything else you like, as it is he's quite plain. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - I've seen your other work and you have some good fundamentals, but this piece feels halfassed honestly. I don't know if you ran out of time or what, but I really hope to see better next weekend. If the shading and painting stuff is what threw you off, stick to what you know but try make it more finished than this weekends entry. </p>

        <p>Minimal effort put into indicating texture or material. Only a slight definition of forms and lighting. The composition is lacking unity, and leads the viewer out of the frame.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - While its a pretty cute little moment captured here, theres not much to talk about. its functional, but red riding hood is just leading the wolf to somewhere. it would be nice to know where they are heading, or at least to know where they are. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The hatching is pretty nice, especially on Reds hood, and the color choices are nice if a bit simple. The drapery is also pretty good on red too, surprisingly so. the anatomy does need some work however, mainly the wolf. his chest and shoulders are just very stiff and referencing people with similar builds would help in refinind/defining his anatomy. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - again, the issue here is that there just isnt much to critique. where are they? where are they headed? why is red leading the wolf around? a lot of questions are raised by the absence of explanation, either in the image or outside of it in the description. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - when you get more comfortable with construction and gesture your score here will increase to match.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - There's some thought put into composition and I like how central the main character is, and how their feet and the peacock feathers help with the depth. The foreground beaks are very basic though, and I feel they take away from the rest of the piece, some more design into the foreground aspects would have helped.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - There's some difference between the more stringy texture of the peacock feather and the other on body feathers which is nice. The colours overall are nice and things like the lighter background behind the darker figures looks good. I think focusing on rendering out the focal point the most is a good thing to do, but not when it's at the expense of the rest of the piece. Maybe you just ran out of time but the unfinished figures and foreground beaks and so on bring the rest of the piece down. I hope you can pace things better next weekend.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Only you would paint something like this kek. There's some really nice things like the difference in how the main characters head looks compared to the other birds and so on. It'd just be nicer if things were more finished, it'd be easier to grade too. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You don't have any trouble using digital, I think pacing yourself and using your time better is going to be the biggest things you can do for improvement. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - i dont know what to really say about the composition itself, its just the main character surrounded by a bunch of other crows. the main character and their accesories are within focus and theres nothing distracting from those elements. theres nothing going on in the background though, and the other crows seem mostly inconsiquential as only one is really doing anything of note. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - the general level of detail, gesture and color work are all fairly strong, but the brushwork is pretty hazy, especially on the peacock  feather, where the most time really should have been spent. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Really like the thought you've put into all the aspecs of this piece, having the window there so we can see the tree is nice and also lets you have this great lighting on the woman's face. The "looked at him fiercely" thing really comes across too. Things feel a bit flat in terms of depth, but that kind of helps things feel a little uneasy I think.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The rendering on the faces and hand is really great, and I love the colour choices. The tree and background could be better, and the hatching on the walls is a slight distraction to me. Great attention to details though like the skull, the curls of the hair, and the woman's hat. Compared to the rest of her body though her head is pretty big, but maybe this is a deliberate choice to continue making things feel eerie.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - It goes really well with the source material I think, the creepiness of the Brothers Grimm stuff comes across well. I would have liked to see more of the room they're in, or maybe some more design into the child or the garden in the background. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Coloured pencil on black paper can be tough but you did really well with it, the faces and her hand are really the highlights of the piece, great job on those especially. </p>

        <p>The various levels of abstraction and realism is a bit jarring, but the artist has a firm grasp on the medium, and work with color and texture helps bring it together to some extent. The L-shaped composition is unorthodox, but it helps create an impression unease (but try to avoid tangents). There's effort put into abstracting the face, but at the cost of losing shapes.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - the uncanny nature of the womans design works well  with the stilted visuals in creating  an uncomfortable atmosphere. that being said, while the general placement of elements is functional, its composition itself is nothing remarkable. the application of negative space in places seems mostly unintentional, and im not really sure what purpose the tree has to the overall piece, as there is nothing especially notable about it or the scenery outside aside from its comparitive mundanity.    </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The overall structure of the piece and general lack of polish would normally consititute a score of 2, but the color work and unique hatching method is very strong and with some refinement could be extremely effective in the future. if nothing else, this is probably the most interesting piece to look at as a result. It is clear however that the lack of structure is holding you back, with the most substantial evidence of this being how the background is on a tilt. Rulers are your friend mate, use them when you need to. There is a bit of tonal whiplash in this as weell, as the interior of the house is so bleak and oppresive that it adds a lot to the image, but then the outside is, as mentioned earlier, extremely mundane. it may have been better for you to ommit the outside portion entirely and focused more on furnishing the walls to add to that oppresive mood.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em>3 - The rough style of coloured hatching is extremely evocative and gets across the intensity of the situation. Its the strongest part of your piece. the situation isnt presented in any unique context however, so while ill give you points for the unique coloring method, i cant really give you any more points for anything else here.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1  - You know your way around coloured pencil well enough, but the hatching is extremely sloppy. Some Roughness in technique is acceptable, and even a lot of it is in certain situations, but its clear that your rough hatching isnt exactly intentionally rough, more likely it is a result of you leaning into a weakness in your ability to create a solid effect, which while very smart of you, doesnt really say anything of your actual ability.</p>

        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - The fundamentals you've shown are good, the values and shape design are nice. There are some changes I would make like her nose being quite big, or increasing the highlights of her hair against the dark backdrop, but her features all work together to make quite a nice character. The costume design looks nice too, it would be great to see things more finished.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - If I knew who the character was or the story she's from maybe this interpretation would seem more original to me, but as it is it's just a portrait so could be anyone. Some more story to the next piece would be nice, think about what she could be holding or expressions and things like that.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your rendering is nice with this piece and I like the values of the hair being darker so she's nicely seperated from the backdrop. I can see how much effort you've put into this and it's a step up from things I've seen from you before, good job. I look forward to seeing what you can do with more time or using what you've learned from this week for the next submission.</p>

        <p> A portrait in graphite(?). It's a safe premise to free up effort and time for other things, like designing and rendering. Not a bad choice at all, and rather shows some good judgement for an artist of intermediate skill, in a time pressed challenge like this. Unfortunatley, large parts of the piece is still left unfinished. Good build-up of tone, and mix of edges. There is, however, a clear lack of cast shadows and indication of the major planes.

        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - you have good control of your values, and thats really all that can be said of this. its hard to read any further into this because its unfinished and i feel like you would have pushed the values even further had you spent more time on this. The face isnt great however, the structure is kind of off. the eyes dont appear to be wrapping around the face at all, more like the face was stretched out a bit so that both eyes could fit. thats the feeling i get from it anyway. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - The idea here is solid, and I think the lighting especially helps with things. Some more depth would be nice though, maybe if the branch/tree the wren is sitting on was coming from the viewer towards the bear more. I think that was the idea, but it reads like it's going mostly from left to right at the moment. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Really solid effort with the lighting, and I like the colours too. More attention and practice with textures would be a good thing to focus on, for fur and foliage you don't need to and in fact shouldn't try paint it all out, just have enough things catching the light or showing the shadow to sell the idea. Sometimes less is more. You also made good effort to have the focal points sharper and higher contrast than the rest of the piece, which helps lead the eye a lot. You say it turned into a mess and you got tired of looking at it, I'd suggest going from big shapes to small shapes slower next time. Jumping straight into the tiny brush rendering gives you a ton of work to do and makes it more challenging, try building the forms up slower and only go really small for important details and things catching the light.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - I can see the idea quite clearly here even though the piece itself is unfinished. The feeling is really nice and I honestly look forward to seeing what you can do with more time and practice. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I don't think you have a problem with the medium as much as the workflow. Jumping into small rendering too soon like I said earlier can give you much more work to do. You'll figure out different processes and ways of doing things though as you go along, and get faster at the same time, which will mean things being more finished. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - its certainly an intersting scene with the tree lying across the top of the bears den, and the lighting is pretty nice considering how far you got with it, but much like many other people, having unfinished work doesnt get you extra point. at the moment, everything is too vague to really award you any more points for the composition.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - the colors are again, pretty nice, but im certain if you just stuck with this, this could have turned out a lot better. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - due to how vague the composition is, and just the fact that you didnt get to finish it, its hard to judge what you would have brought to the table if it was finshed, so i have to judge whats in the picture currentely. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - You managed to fit everything in, but it's a little cramped and some of the positions are awkward. A double bed might have worked better for example, her new suitor is in a bit of an awkward position and is probably close to falling off the bed. I'm glad that we can see everything though. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The anatomy might be bent in places but overall they look nice, the obvious focal point is very noice, the squishy thigh and highlights on the pussy for example. Managing to show all the physical action as well as Old Mr Fox, her expression, the tails and outfits etc is impressive I think, that's a lot of things to fit in. Your rendering could use some work, but you of course had limited time like everyone did, and I'm sure the hair and fabric rendering took some time. The colours and lighting are pretty nice too. I think polishing the other focal points a bit more would help, for example more detail in her face and chest. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Great take on the story and I like the character and costume designs a lot.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You know what you're doing with your medium and it's great that you got so much done in the limited time you had. I'd like to see some more attention to how skin catches light and looks different when it's wet and so on, I feel like the difference in materials from fur to cloth to skin would help push your work up a notch. </p>

        <p>A nice subdued but varied color palette. Little effort made to render fabric – like points of tension and masses on and under the sheets. Good work separating light and shadow into separate shapes, but a poorly established light source renders it somewhat scattershot, and leads to confusion. Depicting multiple interacting figures in perspective is a daunting task for any artist of intermediate skill. A clear lack of understanding of anatomy in perspective leads to strange proportions and placement/facing of body parts.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - the composition is very basic and rudimentary, to the i dont really know what to say about it. maybe fleshing out the room a bit with a bed side table, or an open window that the suitor snuck in with would have been fine, but does that really matter? spending too much time on the background might have taken away from the joke, so im torn on this. actually nah im deducting a point because of the inclusion of text.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Mrs. fox's anatomy is fine and her proportions are mostly fine, but the Suitors are extremley stretched, especially his midsection.pay more attention to your proportions next time. im also not a fan of the brown tinge over the </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 1 - I can see some of the idea here, and like that you went with this over the shoulder pov from the mask's view. You drew in some kind of background but I can barely see it, so I'm not sure what he's standing on or what's going on with the perspective etc, so it's hard to grade. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - Grumpy's face is the best part of the piece I think, the forms with the nose and hat are nice. The curls in the smoke are a nice idea too, but could have been done better. The attention to the gun is also quite nice. Things are lacking overall though, I wish it was more finished so I could tell where he's standing. Some kind of clear light source would be good, and more thought on what angles we're seeing things from, I'm not sure if we're seeing a direct profile of the mask or if we're meant to be slightly over the shoulder kind of behind them. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - I think the idea is good, though I don't know the source story at all so don't know how orginal this depiction is. The feeling is there though even though things are so unfinished, so you've got something from it. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - More practice with the colored pencils would be great, they can be a great medium once you figure things out. I'd like to see you thinking about light, or shading with them more in future, it'd really help show forms more.</p>

        <p>Practically no indication of forms. Due to a lack of experience with the medium, elements and shapes meld together and are ultimately lost. There's a couple of instances where the artist tries to build up a gradient and blend colors, but outside of that there is little evidence of effort or thought put into the palette.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - actually not a bad attempt at a confrontrational composition. Clearly Grumpy and the mask are both getting ready for a fight, which is conveyed pretty impresively despite the mask luiterally only having smoke to do stuff with. The problem withthe composition is mostly just the confused perspective. Grumpy looks like hes coming in from the distance, whereas the mask looks like hes in profile. Grumpy could also be made smaller to make the mask seem more intimidating.  also a genral lack of background does hurt the composition.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - You can apply light coats of color by turning your pencil on its side to fill in large sections without leaving amy white spaces in your colors. hopefully you can do some backgrounds next week using this knowledge. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - I dont know why hes fighting the mask, buy grumpy certainly lives up to his namesake.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - You did well consdering this is an early attempt at using color pencils. keep at it mate, youll get better with them pretty fast i imagine.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Really solid design overall, I can really feel the scale of the tikbalang. Having the character be the light source is great too, makes it feel like the horse is looming over him, helps with the depth a little too. Things might be a little too cropped though, I think seeing the full top of his mane and so on would have been nice. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - The shapes are really nicely designed, the difference between the character and the tikbalang feels huge. I think you could have gone darker with the fur/hair on the legs and mane, and showing the difference in the texture more would be nice, though I can see you did extra hairs at the edges where the light hits. It's hard for me to crit something so stylized but I can definitely feel the Yoshinari.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The character is nice and original for sure, the takbalang slightly less so. I feel like you could have played with his design more, to emphasise a menacing or protective or whichever aspect you choose. He definitely looks like a giant horse man thing but I mean I would like to see more character to him. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - You clearly know what you're doing and it's a great style. It's tough though because where I'd usually reccomend more detailing or attention to a particular area, that might not work with things being stylised the way they are. I hope later in this tourney you make a piece that you yourself are happy with since you say you're not with this one, I look forward to seeing what that's like. </p>

        <p>Nice separation of light and shadow, and indication of cores. The light source itself is hard to locate though, and a few expected cast shadows seem to be missing. It's a nice monochrome palette, but an extension to it might be used to help carve out the smaller figure and make it more distinct; even with the white stroke, it's silhouette is hard to trace, and it's shape is somewhat buried.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The composition of the piece isnt very complex or novel, but it doesnt really need to be. It clearly illustrates the master servant dynamic between Tikbalang and the tamer, and the color choices, while limited, are very nice as well and help serve to direct attention towards the tamer himself without losing sight of the Tikbalang. also the directional scratches for the shadows are a cheap and sneaky way of creating leading lines. i like it.   </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The general Color and line work are all Fairly strong, if unpolished. There isnt really much to say negative about this other than that Tikbalang does show a clear lack of confidence in your knowledge of specifc muscle groups, particularly the forearms. there isnt anything wrong about the muscular anatomy perse, its more that your knowledge of the musculature is somewhat rudimentary. Theres probably some art of Lordgenome or some other muscular character Yoshinari has drawn that you could have looked at that would have been useful in giving said musculature some stylistic direction. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Much like the composition itself, their isnt really anything novel or creative about this picture aside from the style itself. The limited pallete is used effectively and the design of the tamer is equally strong.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - Most of the lack of polish with the shadows and linework is clearly due to time constraints and not because of any lack of knowledge regarding the medium.  </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Really like the design with this, you lead the eye around very well. It's useful that the painting in the story has the arm pointing back out towards the child and pig and you made use of that, and props for using the right painting too. The low camera angle helps with the feeling of wonder the child has too. I think the background feels a bit empty though, as well as the left side of the piece. Time was limited though of course. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - Strong display of perspective skills and planning, the lighting is a bit blown out but I could see that being deliberate too. Some of the saturation/colour feels off to me, like things are really saturated even all the way down the hallway, and things like the pigs shadow are pretty strongly coloured. Little details like the rays of light from the windows, the boys hair or the curve of fur on the pig's leg are really nice. I think texturing the floor differently would add a little bit to the piece, making it stone or marble or something to separate it better from the walls, since their values are colour are quite similar right now. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The pig design and overall design of the piece shows a clear vision, which I think is great. I feel like the background is a little bare though, I don't know how much of that is time limitations and how much is not having enough time though.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You look very comfortable with digital painting, I think edges could use some work but that might be another time limitation thing.</p>

        <p>A fine example of how to construct perspective to enforce narrative and mood in a scene. Even in an interior scene like this, the artist uses atmospheric perspective to give depth. Some material indication seems to be missing and the piece overall only suggests a higher level of finish. This is not for lack of understanding, but rather a consequence of the time constraints, suggesting some lack of judgement on the artist's part regarding scope and time in relation to their level of proficiency.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Its a very strong composition, the leading lines work well for both adding lots of depth and mystery to the piece as well as directing even more attention to the boy and pig, more attention than what they were already commanding anyway. my only real problem is just the sheer amount of blue. i cant really say its a bad choice or anything like that, im just not a big fan of the color. i dont care if thats a stupid reason, theres just too much blue. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - Solid fundies all around, good use of color, has a nice atomsphere, it ticks all the right boxes, but theres nothing that really takes it over the edge in any particular way. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - its a bit hard to tell what the boy is thinking, but other than that i just like the scene. its a very cute moment in a rather ominous setting. i guess whimsical is the word id use to describe this.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Pretty ambitious design for a piece, well done for that and for completing so much of it with limited time. That said some things are placed a bit oddly, for example the hand pointing from the right is mostly off screen and doesn't have enough importance in my opinion. It's harder to arrange things as you go like in digital though, and you also said the photo cropped some things a bit. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - There's good use of texture and you did really well to fit so much in and keep things pretty balanced and not cluttered. Some of the perspectives are off though, the door and table in particular make things look weird. Your anatomy needs some work too, I know you've started doing more figure stuff and less still lives lately so keep that up. I think the values are ok in general considering it's pencil, I think a solid white for the tablecloth would be better though, and darkening some things like the cage in the background so it's more separated from the backdrop. There's definite gains being made though, good job.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - I really like the story that's in this piece, and how you've shown things in progress rather than a still piece with nothing happening. It would have been easier but wouldn't have told as much story as this one. The attention to all the items on the table is good too, and makes me want to look closer and see what everything is. I think more attention to the character design in future would really help you level things up overall.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You did very well to do this traditionally, and getting all this texture and detail in with pencil is good. I think pencils limit possible value range a bit but you did very well with what they can do. </p>

        <p>Good effort put into details and background. It indicates thought was put into the scene and what's happening in it, but it seems no construction was made to set up perspective. There is very little build up of values, and no light source has been established. The composition centers on the main PoI, but it's surrounded by elements that pull away from it and out of the frame.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Its really not clear whats going in the drawing, i had to read the title to understand that this was about hansel and gretel because i didnt even see the cage the first time around. Maybe a different angle where all 3 characters are in frame or highlighting gretel a bit more would have would have worked. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Your fundamentals are a bit sloppy mate. the perspective is very strange as the toble and background seem to be following 2 different VP's, making the whole room look like its built on an incline. the Characters themselves also arent really great either, they are just kind of flat. Hansel is clearly meant to be fat, but theres no real depth to him, he just looks sort of wide, and his forearm proprotions are also a bit wonky. The shading is nice, however it feels like you are hiding behind it when you should really be focusing on the drawing, not the shadows and lighting details. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - You just kinda drew what was in the story. its not particularly orginal, but thats not a bad thing either.  you just need to find some way to make the scene itself more interesting, find a new way of telling the same story as it were. maybe if we were looking at this scene from gretels point of view, or from the witches, or maybe if this was exxagerated to emphasize the panic/gluttony of hansel. theres a lot of things that could be done, you just need to go for it. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - its clear you kno you way around a pencil, but you really should focus on the drawing side of things and less on the shading stuff as stated earlier. that being said, you dont have to ditch it competely, just shift your focus is all. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - There's a clear design here and it's very illustration feeling which is nice. I think more depth would be good, maybe pushing things so the witch feels more behind them and less above. The front of the canvas is a bit empty too, even making Hansel and Gretel larger would help I think. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Things feel unfinished so it's hard to score everything. Some of the rendering is nice, the bird especially, and I like the attention to folds on the outfits. Overall though the colours and values are all quite close to each other when you could have made the siblings brighter or more finished to draw attention to them, and make the witch more menacing in the background in comparison at the same time. The witch, background and some of the faces could still use work, but I understand about time being limited. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - Solid depiction of a classic story, and you had a clear idea for the overall design of the piece which I like. I think you could have been more adventurous with the characters, don't be afraid to really exaggerate the witches features for example. More thought on the colours or background would have helped you too. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You know what you're doing with the medium but some things could use work. The mix of hard and soft edges works well in the fabrics for example, but less so with the hair and faces. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The traingular placement is a bit basic, but definitely effective as a composition, demonstrating both the antagonistic role of the witch and the vulnerable nature of the kids. The colors themselves are hit or miss though. theres just a lot of brown which meshes with the hair of the kids, which i realise thats why the goose's wings are spread out like that, but still.  the brown and green works as a color scheme, but thee values need to vary a little bit more so foreground elements to start mixing in with the background.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - While the colors chosen work well, the values arent exactly the greatest. the shading feels almost like cell shading, which can work, but here it just feels a bit flat. it works surprisingly well for the goose, but thats likely because of how thin feathers tend to be and the tubular nature of the goose's neck. the witch is interesting, hunchedback and imposing. its a good look. the linework on her is confusing however, im just i dont really know what kind of effect you were going for, but it is a bit distracting. anatomy wise, proportions need some work, hansel and gretels right and left arms respectively are are twice the length of their other arms and it just looks a bit strange. the dark patches around their eyes are also very strange too, it contributes to a kind of uncanny feeling.  the clothes however actually look pretty nice, the simple blocky shading works well for all the creases and folds on their sleeves.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The composition and facial expressions make the image come off almost like a manga cover, which is certainly interesting but probably not intended. Nothing else really stands out as unique however.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - i think focusing on making things look good with just linework during the initial planning stages will help you improve your understanding of painting going forward.  the best painters also draw afterall. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Great idea with the skull composition, it's an ambitious move. Having the fire contrast with the black of the animals and people works nicely. I think the castle would work better with more perspective to it, and darker so it reads easier, but that could also affect the overall skull readability. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The fire is nice, as are things like the shape design of the silhouettes and the starry night sky, but the bodies hanging from the gallows need work as does the castle in the background. Running out of time is understandable and you did go pretty ambitious with your idea. I think you could have pushed the lighting difference more, making the fire more obviously the light source and having it glow more than the rest of the painting. I don't know if you considered edges and sharpness too, most of the painting is similar in these aspects. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Really like the skull design and how it has multiple parts of the story all incorporated into it, very nicely done idea. These kinds of things work great as posters or covers for things, great potential. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I think you could think more about edges and texture next time, though you used some brush techniques for these with the night sky and the almost watercolour bleeding effect of the fire and the wolves which I really liked.</p>

        <p>The concept and composition is creative. The artist shows proficiency with the digital medium in creating a traditional texture. The palette is a little lacklustre, and the brush work is somewhat muddled. This, together with what seems like compositional afterthoughts, lessens what is a striking expression.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - It looks like some fucked up cave painting mixed in with a mural. its great. the only thing really bad about the composition is the smoke, the hazy quality of it gets in the way of the other elements of the composition and looks a bit messy. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - its a bit hard to judge your fundamentels due to the abstract nature of the piece, but still things to critique. Its clear you tried to add as much details to the sillhouettes as you could, but that has its own pitfalls. the wolves for example didnt really need to have all 4 of their front fangs drawn in, you could have gotten away with just 2 because of how the wolves were drawn in a profile,. The smoke too, as mentioned previously, is more of a distraction than anything. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 5 - this mural has some S O U L. at least a few souls. The way all the encounters are incorporated into this drawing are great too. primo story telling right here. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - There are methods of creating cleaner shapes when painting. you can block in your basic shape, and carve away at the blocked in shape on the same layer with other colors. you can get some really clean shapes from from sillhouettes for example if you do that. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Ambitious but could be done much better. There are a lot of different elements in here all vying for our attention perhaps more or less than they should be. The girl and her face especially should be larger and more of a focal point, and things like her basket of apples and so on could be smaller in comparison. I like the POV aspect though, the floorboards and footprints etc help with the depth a bit, the lighting being centred is a good idea but I think having an actual source for it might help sell things better, say if it was from an open window or skylight or something. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - There's evidence of the fundamentals here; perspective, depth, leading the eye, texture etc, but things need worked on some more. You gave yourself so much to do with this and no doubt didn't have enough time to finish up everything, maybe better pacing of yourself is a good thing to focus on for the next prompt. The claws are pretty nice, I like the colour change and the attention to texture. The girl herself and things like the body in the background bring the rest of the piece down though, and the overall design things mentioned already. If it had been much simpler it might have been less ambitious, but would have given you more time to really work on things and bring up the overall quality. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - The idea is solid tbh, the POV aspect is an unusual take and having the girl's face and horror be the centre point is a good idea, especially for dark fairy tales that's a very key part of the story. I think more thought into lighting etc would have helped, whcih again if this piece was simpler overall, like just the hands and the girl even, you would be able to focus on designing those parts more.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You made some good uses of the medium, like the colour change on the claws or the soft brushes for lighting, but there's much you can still learn. I would reccomend practicing working from big shapes to small shapes more slowly, if you switch to a small detailing brush too soon like you seem to have done with the claws or the girl's hair, you give yourself a lot more work to do and it also doesn't read as well. I hope you can pace things better for the next prompt and show what a simpler but more finished piece would look like.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - This is a avery efficient piece in terms of the placement of elements. There is very little wasted space but its not overly cramped either. Some things in the scene are a bit too orderly like the perfect line of apples and how everything that isnt pinned down is pointing towards red riding hood. The red haze is also a bit distracting, but i get that its meant to be emblematic of a sort of bloodlust or whatever. But in general everything is placed in the scene well.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - youve been improving steadily, but many things are still out of your scope atm. the fur is pretty bad and the anatomy in general is closer to a stick figure than anything. your saving grace in all of this is that theres no ambiguity as to what anything is. but that doesnt get you bonus points. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The first person take on this is actually really cool. you dont normally get to see the story from the wolfs perspective, and the having the viewer be the aggresor in the situation is a nice change of pace from some of the more calm and dissasociative pieces in the competition so far. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - Your overall lack of competence is mostly a result of your general inexperience with art. You are just going to have to power through it before you see any real change sadly.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Great job having so many different characters and not just fitting them all in but having good movement and story to it. I wish the background had more to it but I understand time limitations being an issue.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - Really nice work on the goats and wolf, both in terms of lines and things like perspective. I wonder what things would be like if taken further and you had time to have different values, color, and so on. Even making the wolf darker in general would be better I think, and would make his white feet more obvious too. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The movement and story to the piece is really nice, and it shows a clear part of the story as well as other things that will happen later which is nice. I think a clearer idea of background and maybe more dramatic lighting showing the wolf has just burst through the door would bring things up a notch, and as I said before I'm curious how you would have done the colours and things later</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - The linework is really nice, I would have like to see more use of the texture and shadows though, they're pretty sparse at the moment. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - The composition itself isnt anything particularly special, but it is very competent. its hard to really say anything about it as a result. theres a far bit of unused space above the wolf, so maybe going for a higher (or lower) angle to reduce it would have been good. Regardless, the composition is very solid, it only needs a bit of tweaking.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - Well, they all look like real animals. the baby goats dont have expressive faces, but thats a limitation of reality moreso than yourself. the goats themselves look more like they are playing than running away, but again, its hard to really get that across when adhering to reality so strictly.  i think maybe going for more panicked body language would have worked well for this, having the goats frantically kicking things out of the way as they run to safety. Aside from that, this is very well done, its just a shame that you didnt get around to coloring it.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 -One of the limitations of realistically proportioned characters is that its hard to justify changes in  the service of story telling, so its hard to begrudge the result. I cant get away from this nagging feeling that, had you more time, you would have figured out a way to be more expressive with these designs. Sadly i have to judge the piece as a final product, and you didnt really do anything different enough to get more than 3 points in this regard. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - i dont know what im meant to tell you. finish your work next time damnit. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Really strong design and a clear idea behind it. The things coming out of the frame is especially good, and the shading on and under the water help with the depth I think. All the diagonals are nice too. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - Your colour and design skills are so high they carry the weaker aspects. Namely I think you could have rendered the water in a way that the material is more obvious and I think some of the water droplets and fish are placed where they are just because it looks nice overall, without thinking how to use them to help things read even better. I feel like you could have used the fish casting shadows on each other more to make some of them seem further in the background or deeper in the water, or even to make them seem like they're changing direction and not all on the same flat plane. The character is nice and cute as usual, but the head seems more 2D than the body somehow, maybe shading things a little differently would help the form read better. The lighting around the character and the wave is good and makes it an even clearer focal point. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - It's a very appealing piece and has good story and direction to it. I feel like you could have put more thought into how the fish are moving and maybe what the background to everything is, but that's nitpicky. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - You clearly know just what you're doing with your medium, it's up to you to push yourself more and try different things with it. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - The general placement of elements, Direction, and color are all extremely strong. The simple clean shape of the water adds to the sense of diminutive scale. However, the level of detail in these elements is almost simple to a fault. i feel there is a missed opportunity to really sell how harsh the situation is for issun by not messing with the linework of the wave, or by showing the turbulence of the water underneath somehow. that however is a nitpick admittedly. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - you had a clear idea of what you wanted to make and you set out to do it. it does help that your general style is a lot more well realised than many others so its not really surprising that you were able to polish this in such a short amount of time. There are some weaker points with this piece, and maybe with your style as a whole that do need to be adressed. almost every element within the image is extremely soft, round and smooth. This malleable look works well in many scenarios, but it does have its shortcomings with regards to rough or sharp settings/objects/characters. the lone section of ground that we see being the main offender in this piece, as it is so round and smooth that it almost looks soft as a result. I think you need to experiment more with hard edges and surfaces in future works. Also are used extremely effectively despite the dynamics of light and shadow not really being pushed to their fullest. The light from the needle really should be penetrating the waters surface and result in harsher shadows on Issun, but the piece works well enough without it that im letting it slide. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - As mentioned earlier, your style is among the most realised in DAD.theres still some aspects to your style that could be pushed further, some elements that need to be inspected, but in general your style of thin limbed chibi-esque characters and linework carry what would otherwise be an unremarkable piece. Plus, you were the only one on this taiwanese sandcastle building forum to actually use a japanese fiary tale as your source. I guess weebs were watching more another FOTM anime this week.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - There isnt much to say here. you know how to use the tools you have, and you arent limited by your medium of choice in any obvious manner.  </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - I like the overall design and the depth is quite nice, though maybe some foreground elements would help this more. As it is, she's quite close to the trees both in positioning and lineweight etc, so it doesn't read great at a glance. A different value on the figure or the trees, or a bolder outline around her would make things read much better and also still go with the graphic look you have going on.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The lines and overall shapes are real nice, I especially like her mask and sweater. There's no attempt at different values however, not to mention colour and so on, which is fine but makes it hard for me to score things. I also feel like more attention was given to the top of the figure than the bottom, the shoes and bottom of the legs especially could use work. The tree texture is quite nice tbh, but the grass and foreground need something more to them imo. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - Having this cool post apoc? take on red riding hood is nice, and makes me want to see what the rest of the story like this would be like. At the moment though only the figure and a couple of other things are figured out though, I think a clearer vision of the woods around them and better framing of the wolf would have brought things up. A clearer overall idea, rather than it being very clear for a couple of things and then less thought out the further we get from the focal point. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I think your lines look great, I hope to see some differences in line weight and maybe texture in the next one. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - a fairly standard composition, but very well done despite how unfinished it was. Due to the lack of variance in line weight, parts of the trees do blend in with Red riding hood, and while im sure thats not something that could be adressed if you had more time, the piece as is looses a bit of its function as a result. adding a halftone to the trees to seperate them from the character in the foreground would have alleviated this issue, without being too time consuming.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The linework is very solid, the general sense of mass for the main character and their baggy clothing is all there, thats all solid, but the rushed value work (or lacktherof) is dissapointing. I assume this was rushed to completion, because these kinds of mistakes dont seem indicative of your overall skill level. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Turning Red riding hood into a russian is certainly an interesting idea, the image itself doesnt really make that obvious. if the title didnt tell me this was based on red riding hood, or if i saw this outside of the context of the tourney i really wouldnt have been able to tell. its a cool piece, and i know im going to get shit on for rating this a 3,  but creativity doesnt mean much if the person looking at the image cant tell what the intention is without outside context. its got SOUL though, i aint denying that. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - Finish your fucking work next time >:( its good shit but i want to judge finished pieces</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - The overall design is really nice, the spotlighting on the goose helps things and gives us a very strong focal point. I think more foreground elements might be good though, the guy feels a bit flat and cut off, and the leaves and branches in the foreground are very much 2D right now. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 5 - Really beautiful choice of colours and light, and the rendering pulls it all together. The goose in particular is top notch, and the very saturated lights on her wings, the edge of the trunk above her and even catching the little motes in the light are great. I think the guy's outfit could use a little more work, the colours are just as great but I think you could use the folds and shadows more to make him feel more 3D. The background is simple but deliberately so, so it doesnt distract, but I do think a little more foreground elements might be nice. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - Really beautiful idea and execution. The guy's outfit and design in general could be more adventurous though, even if we're only glimpsing him from behind. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - You used all your edges, layer modes and brushes really well and it all helps sell the piece more, well done.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Similar to Nessie's piece this is just a very well balanced composition. Theres a good use of light rays here to highlight both the wings of the goose girl, as well as also just highlighting the girl. despite the level of contrast between the boy and the girl, the boy is too distracting either, and the background has just the right amount of detail to be noticeable but not distracting.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - Anime is hard to judge because no matter what advice i give regarding how faces should work, or how limbs could posed, theres going to be evidence that works against me, so ill just focus on the more objective stuff, like boys stretched out figure. he is extremely thin, i dont know if this is just a stylistic choice, but its quite noticable. or at least i noticed it a lot, which is unfortunate because despite how prominently hes displayed within the frame its clear that you arent meaant to pay attention to him, at least not for that reason. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - I dont quite get this trend among the (supposedly) non-furry girls to try and make the animals sexy. its certainly an idea though.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Pretty adventurous piece, the idea is clear but there's so much information and objects in it that it lessens the readability. I like the idea of having the shopkeeper pure black, maybe making the values for the back of the shop vs the closer stuff more different would have helped things read better too. The perspective of the desk/table whatever feels a bit off, but the way things lead around the corner is nice and make me want to go and explore the shop.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - While you have great attention to detail and the even the perspectives of individual books and so on, there's so much going on in this that it works against you. The different line weights of things are a bit confusing too. There's some good use of stroke direction on the shalves and so on, and texture for the wood, but sometimes this feels less thought out, like at the back wall. I think the darker elements like the birds and cat are great, but they could be bigger and have more attention to them, the same with the candle lights, they could be lighter overall too. I think balancing the attention and detail should be your main focus at the moment, and making things read better at a glance. I also can't score anything like colour with this, which brought things down a little.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - A very ambitious thing to draw, but I love all the detail and keep finding new things which I hadn't noticed before. The shop is a nice mix of interesting but also slightly uneasy, like with the shopkeeper's face being hidden as he watches you, I think this all fits well with the source story. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your idea comes across well and I definitely admire the patience and attention to detail that you have. I think some better use of lineweights and maybe different brushes to show lighting or texture might help you in future. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The composition itself is solid.  theres no wasted space, and everything is cluttered in a manner that suits this strange cat merchant. that being said, it is very cluttred and the scratchy shading adds a lot of unnecesary noise to an already noise image. you need to balance out messiness with cleaner elements otherwise it all just ends up becoming white noise. regardless of that, placeing all of the cleaner elements (the kitse, map and the majority of the visible floor) in the middle of the image was smart and helps save what would have otherwise been a jumbled mess.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - the persepctive doesnt really seem to follow any rules. things just sort of grow and shrink based mostly on your understanding of perspective, and while that adds a sort of whimsical nature to the image, its clearly not intentional. The general scratchiness of all the shading isnt great either, it adds a nice sense of wear and tear to the shop, but that was already achieved with the cracked wood floor and counter, The linework in general is also pretty sloppy. thats not always a bad thing, but much like the scratchy shading, moderation is key.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - S O U L </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - this mostly just comes down to your linework. either you dont know how to control your lines, or you just dont know when to focus on clean lines vs unclean ones. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 1 - The composition is one of the better things about this, having the path and figure leading us towards the house is a good idea. I think things are pretty empty overall though, and more things for scale between the figure and the house would really help. Likewise there's little going on with the trees or the path other than the couple of mushrooms, you could do much more with all this space.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 0 - There's some thought put towards things like composition or having the path lead our eye to the house, which has some basic perspective on it. I won't crit too much because most things need work. I think most useful for you right now would be looking at illustrations and things that you like, and how people frame things and tell a story in a single image. Even if you could render perfectly and paint like a ghibli artist and stuff, I don't think they would frame an image quite like this. Your very black shadows on the figure are at odds with the rest of the piece too, having those just on the figure makes it clash a bit. Maybe keep things all pencil for the next piece, or more unified in general. I've looked at some of your other work and you can render and use pencils ok, maybe you were a bit ambitious to have trees and everything all in one big piece. I get that you ran out of time but having things be really placeholder or unfinished like the trees or the stones marking the path brings everything down overall.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - The idea is there, and I like you showing us the house as well as the different environments of the woods, an open space around the house, and hills/mountains in the background. More thought into what to have between all these would be good though, things don't have to be cluttered or stuffed full of things, but it feels empty at the moment and that works against you. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - If it had all been in one medium I think it would have read better, as it is the very strong shadows on the figure clash with the rest of the piece. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2- the composition is functional, but theres really not a whole lot going on. theres lots of empty space thats not really being used for anything and what is there doesnt really do much other than illustrate the story. There would be no downsides to bringing the house a lot closer or making it bigger in this particular instance. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1- your main issue right now is just perspective. drawing large backgrounds can be daunting, but you need to pay attention to the smaller stuff too like the house. the roof of the house looks like its slipping off because the house underneath it is so small for example. the cast shadows from Red riding hood and the house are also pointing in 2 different directions despite the sun being (presumably) the only light source, which you probably know shouldnt really be the case. going forward, i want you to pay attention to those small details, being cognisant of such things will allow you to make more consistant and polished drawings in the future.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1- its just Red Riding Hood emerging from a forest. maybe with some additions to the scene like the wolf hiding in a bush nearby, or maybe  something else to add some context/flavour to the scene, but for now there just isnt much to talk about. you just need to add something, anything really.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0- Its clear you are fairly new to drawing, but you'll get better in time. Dont take the low score as a reson to give up, all it means is that you have room to grow. Just keep practicing your fundamentals, keep testing yourself, and dont forget to let yourself have fun with the medium :)</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Pretty cool design, things like the straw going outside the frame is nice, or the wheel behind her head. I feel like the background doesnt read very well though, maybe light from a window or something being cast over the big pile of straw would help. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Really really nice work on the texture and colours of the hair, I love that. The straw to gold effect is nicely done too. The values for the piece as a whole feel out of balance though, with both foreground, background and borders being very dark. More thinking to light source would help you I think, and would help by giving you clear highlights to place on the figure, shadow from folds in the clothing etc. I feel like the foreground hands could be a bit larger or better placed too, or maybe them being dark just makes them get lost in the background and borders.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - Very nice illustrative idea, I really like the idea of seeing the straw spinning into gold and it's nicely done. Maybe you could have continued this idea around the frame and had the straw to gold as the border or something. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - The colours and rendering are ok, the attention to how gold catches the light and changes colour especially is nicely done. The skin and fabric could use a lot of work though, even just filling in the clothes as one shape and then rendering it with a clipping mask would help things read better and save you time. I'm sure you'll get faster and find easier ways to get the effect you want with the next prompts. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Its almost a 3 but theres some issues with the composition. Theeres stuff i like, such as the golden straw being wound  accross the horizontal axis, the girls pose, how her head lines up with the milling wheel, all good ideas. There are problems however. The biggest problem is the black borders on the side. I dont really get what they are meant to be, are they meant to be a door frame? A window? I'm not sure and it doesnt make sense. Why didnt you just cut them out or extend the background so you didnt need the borders at all? the colours are also just really murky overall and i dont think they contribute to any kind of mood . It's just a really dark background with a comparitively bright figure in front of it. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - the biggest point of contention here are the colors. the color choices by themselves are fine, but the blending is all over the place. The girls hair is mostly just a mess of greens and reds, her skin looks sunburnt, and the hands in the foreground are just in a different style to everything else with those bold outlines. Again, the color choices are actually not bad. the hair almost works strangely enough. but thats the thing, it almost works. a lot of these elements are just a step or two away from actually being functional, but for now they are mostly just unfinished ideas. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - Much like your composition, there are elements of this that are potentially really good. the problem is that you failed to string them together in a cohesive manner. The almost GD-like use of the golden sraw is great, but it doesnt lead to anything. The girls pose is similarly good (if hampered by some mediocre anatomy) but shes looking at me, not Rumplestiltskin, and the Milling wheel lining up with her head is probably more of an accident than anything. Theres good stuff to work with here, but you need to string these elements together somehow for them to work. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - you arent being obviously limited by whatever program you use, more that you just dont have the artistic knowledge to make use of it as effectively as you can. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Great design and really helps tell the story. I feel like there could be more emphasis on the fire and pitchforks though, they get a bit lost behind everything else at the moment. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 5 - Really very nicely done, it's impressive you got so much done with such a short deadline. The costumes and faces are beautiful, and the lighting on them especially. I feel like values of the background stuff might be a little close to the figures, and you could have made the light sources a little more dramatic, but night time scenes are really hard to balance things right and I get that you wanted everything to be visible. Really great work, I can't wait to see what you do for the next prompt.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - The overall design and idea is really nice, and I like how expressive it is and that we can feel how they're being chased/hunted easily. I feel like more thought could have gone into the background elements, or more interesting use of colour (but again it's night time), other than that I don't have much to say. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - You know exactly how to use things to sell your idea, the different rendering techniques of the fur vs skin vs fabric vs foliage are great and help everything work together.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 5 - What stands out most about this is the color work, and where its placed. The characters are extremely obvious, its obvious what they are doing, and the orange light in the centre is pulling double duty both in drawing attention to the hand holding, as well as being used to show what they are running away from. its just really good. maybe the night sky should be darker because it does feel a bit unnecesarily bright, but ultimately that doesnt matter too much to the overall quality of the compostion. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - The only real negative thing i have to say about this is that the girl's facial expressions dont really tell me much. the sheep girl looks worried, but the human girl doesnt really have much of an expression, her brow is just a bit furled. beyond that, the colors  work is extremely strong, nothing is too bright or dark (except for the night sky itself but thats not anything to worry about.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - just a good use of the source material to create a new situation for the characters.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - The idea is there but doesn't seem fully thought out, I'd suggest doing more thumbnails and moving things around until you're really happy with placements. Right now it feels pretty flat, and red riding hood is cut off pretty soon right below her basket. You helped things somewhat by having the foliage behind her be brighter and more saturated but this could have been continued more; having the trees and more distant greenery get darker as they go into the distance. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Different aspects of this are good, like the character is very nice. I can only really see the nice hatching and smaller lines on her when I zoom in though, it doesn't read well when you're looking at the entire piece. Likewise the colours of the leaves are actually really nice, things just feel unfinished overall. You could have gone in on a new layer with multiply or something and just put in some cast shadows from the leaves to make the trees instantly feel more 3D, things like that I guess you just ran out of time to do. I'm sure you'll do better on the next prompt, using time well seems to be something everyone needs to work on.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - While the character is great and had good thought put into her design, the rest is quite plain and could have used more experimenting and trying different options and ideas. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I don't think medium is an issue here, more just pacing yourself better and always thinking about what will read best for the entire piece together. I don't know how much time you spent on the character compared to the background, but I'd bet it's less balanced that it maybe should be. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - good idea, flawed execution. thats probably th best way to describe the composition. having red riding hood trudge from some dense shrubbery while being stalked is a good ideam but having the tree trunks just be vague blobs of color is flawed. at the very least, saturated colors are overall fairly nice.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - The linework is quite nice, theres some good line control and the design of red riding isnt bad, so it makes me wonder why you didnt try to do the whole image with that linework, or at least most of it. You could have used those lines to define the trees, seperate sections of of the tree line with those lines, or even vaguely defined the shape of wolf beyond just the eyes.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - as stated earlier, having Red be stalked in the forest by the wolf is a good idea. its just not a very original one. maybe the wolf could be reaching out towards her, or something could be coming towards Red from outside of the frame. theres a lot that could be done with the concept, you just need to add more to it.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - dont use custom brushes as a crutch. you could do so much better if you just apply yourself. i dont mind if you use brushes to add extraneous details, drawing leaves can be time consuming afterall, but you should rely on the brush to do the majority of your work for you. half the fun of drawing is doing the work yourself. the other half being when you look back your old drawings and become embaressed at your own work. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - The idea is nice but I think needs work particularly on the scale. A lower camera angle might help, so we're closer to Aladdin and he's larger, and we're looking up at this towering genie. As it is right now, he feels tiny but she doesn't feel particularly huge if that makes sense. I also think you could have used the cloud direction to help too, Maybe have them darker and more cramped together closer to the genie, think stormclouds gathering. They use smoke and clouds in the disney movie like this to make the genies feel more powerful. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The colours especially are quite nice, and you have some thought towards things like lighting. Planning out values for the whole piece first would help I think, like if you want the genie to be brightly glowing or dark, is the smoke from the lamp bright like steam or dark like from a fire, etc, these are all things a better value plan would help to sell, as well as separating foreground from background. You did well to render the body so much with a limited time, and there's some attention to edges like the cast shadow from one leg onto the other, that's really nice. More edge control like that all over would be really nice, clouds and smoke especially are really sold by how you blend them. I know you ran out of time but any kind of background would be better than nothing I think, we need a clear foreground, middleground and background, and for them to each have their own value usually. Readability is super important, at the moment the genie is much too close to the sky colour and values for example.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - I like the genie design and the idea of them being so big and feeling like the most important character. Aladdin is very basic though, and you could have been much more creative with how you use the background and even clouds to frame things and lead the eye better. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You used colour pretty well and had some nice edges like I mentioned earlier. Overall though a lot of them are oddly sharp or pixellated, maybe as a result of lasso tool? I'd reccomend trying different techniques to avoid this next time, like painting in the entire base shape and then using clipping masks to paint into it. It's faster than lasso in my opinion and means you don't get artificially sharp edges. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - While it is clear you have some knowledge regarding the fundamentals of composition, its still rather amatuerish. all attention is drawn to the genie while Aladin himself seems almost as important to the overall composition of the piece as the background is. despite Aladin and his lamp being the origin of the smoke that spawned the genie, nothing is directing any attention towards him, or away from him in particular. the genie domniates the composition so thoroughly that leaves little room for anything else to make its mark. Genie makes pp hard though so in some respects your piece is a success. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The piece clearly rushed in places due to time constraints, the color work in particular is very strong on the main focal point; the genie. That being said, some more of this focus on color should have been used to bring attention to Aladin himself and the smoke trail leading to him. The anatomy, or more precisely the gesture of the genie leaves something to be desired. The way her right arm is so obviously longer than her left creates an unnatrual balance displacement that needed to be compensated for somewhere. The genies legs are also unnaturally sloped downards. when people cross their legs, they use one leg to support the other, raised leg, but in the image in question the raised leg is not really being supported by anything because the supported leg is sloped so far down. With all of that being said, i believe this is mostly just an issue with being rushed and ill choose to grade you based on what you have shown you can do in the past, rather than fault you in this particular instance.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - Im torn on this because i saw your progress post regarding this and saw some ambition in it. Time budgets are a bitch. But sadly the only truly original thing you did with the final product was give the Genie a really nice bikini. ill give you a point for that but i need to be fair to everyone else.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - While the overall piece isnt very impressive there are elements of it that do stand out, namely the colors and value work on the Genie herself. i didnt mention it earlier but the hair in paricular is well done. I am a little dissapointed you didnt go with your original concept, but i much prefer. having a finish product to grade than a sketch that only hints at potential. To that end your piece is a success, despite how harsh my criticism are of it. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Solid idea and the warping of things closer to the edges is nice. You could have more depth in the background if you'd wanted, even another few spires and castle parts behind or in front of the first set with another value would make it look less flat, but it's a minor issue.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em>4 - Colour is used nicely, and the attention to detail with the dress and hair and so on is great. I think the trees could be a bit better, and some ref of cracks on glass/mirrors would have been useful too. You can get some seriously sharp edges and changes in value with things like that which would make the cracking effect more readable at a glance, but also might distract a little from the figure so who knows. The logs on the right look a bit off, I'm not sure if they're meant to be logs or steps actually. Some more foreground elements would be nice too, some grass or flowers between us and the dress to show some more depth. These are all nitpicky things though.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Seeing her through the mirror/looking glass/whatever is a nice idea and it comes across pretty well. Her design is very flowy and works perfectly for the princess type fairy tales like this. The environment is pretty basic, but ofc you had to keep it such in order to be finished in time. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I think you know what you're doing with this software really well, but I think you could still streamline some things. Some other submissions used different kinds of brushes well for selling the different textures of things, something like that for the leaves on the trees would be a quick way to make things look even better.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Great overall design of the piece, everything is nicely framed and leads the eyes nicely, including the crows. My only nitpick is that some of the trees on the left side are similar in the direction they're going and this looks a little unnatural. The right side and background trees manage to stay different enough to look more random. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - The lighting is balanced really well overall, the top crow especially looks good. The glow from her blonde hair is really nice too, as are the crows who all help lead the eye back in, nicely planned out. There are some things that don't read very well when you're looking at the whole piece at once though. The crow on the ground is almost lost in the dark, and some details like the sparkles on her skirt or the slight grass on the ground are hard to see. I think you could have had more shadow on the girl herself too, like being cast from her head onto her torso etc, but I'm not sure. Maybe a shaft or two reaching the ground and helping to show the skirt details and the final crow would be nice. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - It's a very well thought out idea and carefully designed, strong illustration feeling like it's for a book cover. Could have been a bit more adventurous with the character or costume design but sometimes minimalist is better</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Everything comes across pretty well, I feel like you could still use the software to make things faster or more streamlined though. Much of the texture seems drawn or painted in manually when you can use brushwork and things to imply this more and save yourself some time. It's nitpicky but I think you can still strive to be more efficient, which would let you get even more done even with short deadlines like this.</p>

        <p> Through competent use of clearly defined shapes, the centered composition still conveys dynamism. The lighting is subtle, and overall proficiently established, but the redndering falls short in som places where forms and volumes need to be indicated. This causes some loss of depth, and gives a flat impression. Stylistic choices notwithstanding, it points towards some lack of deliberation or judgement regarding scope and time in relation to the their level of proficiency.

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - There isnt anything missing from the composition at all, i just want to see some harsher lighting so you could really get to emphasize some of the more interesting shapes in the composition. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - my only real complaint with this is that its very monochromatic. its mostly just variations of blue and white, with some dull browns and golds in the very centre. its certainly a bold choice to do hat, but i think haing some more saturated yellows and reds would have worked really well, especially on the dress.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Nice idea and the sense of scale is really nice. I think the character could be a little larger though, right now we can't see much of him or his expression. The ledge he's on too is also a little small, like I can't tell if it's a solid ledge or if it's a chamfered ridge that he's in danger of slipping off. Having the composition be so wide helps too I think with making the tower seem taller in comparison, though I'm not sure we need as much space to the left. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The colours are really nice and I like the consistent attention to scale, making sure the cracks in the stones and the moss is small in comparison to everything else too. I think some more texture to the stone would be nice though, I can see some graininess in the ones more in shadow in the left but more overall would be nice. More attention to the focal point might be a good idea too, right now some of the leaves have more detail than the guy's hair and face. The background is nice, the mountains feel unfinished but of course everyone had limited time.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - I really like the idea, it shows a part of the fairy tale that I don't usually think about much, the long and difficult climb. Showing the sense of scale and some human tiredness is quite nice too, it makes things more relatable I guess. The sense of isolation is great too. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Everything works well overall, I think with some more use of texture and brushes you could speed up your workflow for things like the stones or the clouds like how you did for some of the foliage details. </p>

        <p>The composition is quite unorthodox, almost like two separate paintings, and gives an impression of vastness. The scene seems to implicate a highly elevated position, but the artist hasn't used perspective to enforce that. Most lines that impact the composition are either perfectly horizontal or perfectly vertical, giving a rigid impression. It's unclear where the focus of the composition is. The primary light source (sun) is visible in the painting, but cast and form shadows don't correlate to it's position.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The composition is a bit flat. its a very effective composition mind you, its very clear what you were going for with the shere scale  being presented, but its very flat. Considering this, maybe if the picture was more vertically oriented it would work better? you would still be able to geep the tower and mountains and all of that, but you would be able to really push the absurdity of rapunzel's hair. The prince also could have stood to be a bit larger, as he gets a little bit lost due in the scene due to his size.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The colors are really nice, they generally work well together and nothing (aside from the prince) feels like its getting lost or dominating the scene too heavily as a result. the he mountains and clouds are a bit basic however. We should really be able to see more of the clouds underside, as the sun is setting, and this would have gone a long way to adding some much needed depth to the scene. the base of the mountains is also a bit pale, youd think those sections were in the shade, and thus a fair bit darker. The prince also seems like a bit of an after thought, the post itself is good, but hes so small that him being in the picture doesnt really mean much sadly. final thing, the tower is facing away from the light source, the prince and the hair should have cast shadows being projected onto the tower. overall a good effort, it just needs some polish in a few places. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The sense of scale is probably the most striking thing about this. most renditions of the story dont really make the tower out to be very tall, but this looks like it could reach past the clouds. nothing else is particularly striking however.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - Its pretty obvious that any limitations you do experience are mostly a result of your general skillset, and not because you dont know how to use photoshop. nothing to really add byi</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Simple but nice design overall, having the dragon's body curve away from us and round a bend really helps with the depth, and I like the spotlit effect on the character. Some more difference in values would have helped the depth even more I think, and the background right now is pretty empty. I think you could have made this piece taller overall, like increasing the top part of the canvas. That could show the spotlighting more as well as making the character seem smaller and the dragon larger.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The colours are quite nice and I really like the lighting and shapes of the character. The dragon could use some work though, even if you just detailed up the head more and left the scales on the body as implied. After the character, the dragon's head will be the next place people look, it's also a decent size and close to us and should have more detail I think. Time was an issue though, and it looks like you spent a good amount of time on the ripples and shadow in the blood. These look great, I just wish the dragon's head received similar attention.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The idea is clear and it shows a particular moment in the story which I like. Having the character framed by the dragon, spotlit, and looking back towards us all works well to bring us into the piece which is great. You could have used the background to help things even more though, maybe something to think about during the thumbnail stage next time.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Things all work well, with clipping masks, texture etc however you could have implied more detail and form to the dragon relatively quickly, which would have helped the overall piece I think.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The elements are generally placed fairly well within the scene, nothign is unclear or dominates the scene too much which is nice. But, its a bit boring to look at. The blood pool in the centre is great, Sigurd looks good, but Fafnir and all the grey is just kind of bland to look at. Stronger reflected lighting from the blood pool, rim lighting on fafnirs head and neck, cuts and scars over fafnirs body, or even just different colored scales, these are all thigns that could have been added to, well, add to the interest of the image. Monochrome color schemes can work well, but most succesful monochrome color schemes have a high degree of contrast, an example of this would be persona 5 and its promo art. you dont have to make it as high contrast as that, but leaning in that direction wont hurt your</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - despite the midling composition, you have a strong style on display that just needs a bit of refinement, though with what is hard to say. a stronger forcus on anatomy would have certainly helped out in this instance, but im not sure that suits your current method of drawing simplified forms, coloring and shading. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - Most of the original ideas are just in the composition. The pool of blood being walled in by Fafnirs corpse and the steam all look sick, i just wish there was more to look at.  </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Simplicity is good for readability, but things could be done better. I think planning values would help you a lot, the fire being a more obvious light source would look nice and could help you show more depth to the room, at the moment it looks right up against the back wall. Using the shadows cast by the fire could also really help to sell Rumplestiltkin's forms easily. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - There's some really nice details here, like the skirting board, or the dark window/painting/mirror on the wall. You gave his head, hair and hand some good attention too, I'd just like to see that attention more evenly spread across the rest of the piece. Some more detail to the floor, even just drawing in some floorboards, would give the piece some needed perspective and help with the depth again. The rendering is quite loose but I think values would help more than just going in and detailing, for example getting the high contrast of the flames against the pot, and the lighter fluffiness of the smoke/steam. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - Again I think the piece being simple isn't the issue here, but it feels an unfinished idea in your head. Little things like what else he has in his room, or what big bits of food we can see in the pot would all help things be more interesting. Things have to read well at a glance which is what my rambling about values is about, but you want enough going on in the piece that people take the time to look and discover things. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - AT the moment it feels like you're changing brush and your strokes almost randomly. The sharp contrasts of flames are very different to the billowing, overlapping soft edges you find in smoke and steam, and you've done most of these in the same way. Try using different brushes for different materials and things, or using clipping masks, lasso tool, just experiment. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - Theres a lot of unused space that doesnt really appear to serve any purpose. The figure in the window is also too vague to be recongnizable as a person. you would have been better served cropping much of the left third/half of the painting using that to emphasize Rumplestiltskin's celebration more.  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Im unsure of what to score you with this. Rumples face is very well done, but the rest of the image is very amatuerish. I hate how mean that sounds but its the truth. . Its hard to tell if the rustic vibe is intentional as a result, but ill give you the benefit of the doubt with this. Rumple's pose is quite stiff despite how energetic i assume you wanted him to be. When people dance, certain parts of the body twist and lead others. Your hips twist first, and the torso lags behind. Your shoulder moves, and the arm follows. Your head turns, the spine twists to match. you can think of it sort of like a conga-line of actions. this isnt always true, but its a good way to think about this stuff in the beggining i think. maybe with more time you would have been able to refine this and prove me wrong.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - there really isnt much evidence of creative thinking here sadly. its just a gnome dancing in his house. Having Rumple dance anround his stew is a nice idea, but it doesnt mean much if theres nothing else to really build on the idea.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 -  you seem to lack brush control. for things like the wall and pot, that isnt so much of an issue, but for the fire and Rumplestiltskin, thats an issue. The fire is so vague that it looks like its being swallowed by middle of the pot, when really the flames should be obscuring the pot instead. Rumple's Linework is also very scratchy and its not clear if you know how to clean it up, assuming you intended to do so in the first place.  </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - The idea for this is ambitious but really cool, more of a graphic kind of design. I think the shadow shapes could be planned better to help things read, they work well on the figure and around him, but get a little confusing as we move further up. Having such solid black shadows really needs them to be well planned out, or they will distract the eye instead of leading it.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - While there is some attention to texture on the tree etc, like the whorls in the wood, it's pretty loose and doesnt help show us the forms much. The character looks good and I like the use of solid shadow on him to show forms a lot, it doesn't work as well for the rest of the piece though. Maybe you could have done some drawings of trees using just pure black to see if you could learn some of how the shapes and texture can be seen even in two tones. I can see some shading on the trunk but it doesnt help much, it might have been better to use for the texture or some cast shadows instead of to shade large sections.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The idea is great, and I think it shows a lot of story and character. Some more technical skill is needed sure, but a good vision is the base of any great piece, and I think you've definitely got some good ones. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - Going trad was a bold move, and things worked ok with most of the piece, and the character especially looks nice. The limited shading capabilites of the medium worked against you on the tree though, either more practice is needed or you should figure out ways to show things differently. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - The spiral composition is a good idea, but there just needed to be more to it. more branches splitting off from the main mass, more feathers, or just something else to fill in the white void woud have been great. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - You leant into the strength of Hard black shows fairly well, but those shadows are still very rough. Hard shadows like the ones you went for tend to work best when the edge of the shadow is just as hard, Mike Mignola's art is a great example of this, where shadows are generally seperated by very strong, bold lines. Try and make your designs work with those hard shadows a bit more in the future, use those shadows to indicate plane changes and depth. Its hard to really crit the fox because controlling your lines when drawing small characters is tough. all i can really tell you to do is to try and be as precise as you can, and eventually youll be able to cram more fine details in those smaller drawings.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - most of the creative value here is from the composition itself, so what i said there applies here. its a good comp, but theres just not a lot here to talk about, just a single spiral, a fox and a crow along the spirals path. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your lines are pretty shakey, but there are ways to mitigate that. when drawing curved structures like tree trunks, its okay to speed up a bit. drawing lines a bit faster can make getting good lines a lot easier. you can think of line quality the same way as riding a bike in some senses, as in, if you ride a bike very slowly its very hard to stay on a straight line, but if you go a bit faster, you are suddenly moving along a straighter path. the same thing happens with your lines depending on how fast you do them. just dont rush yourself either. rushing always makes things worse.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 5 - Really solid design and planning in this, great job fitting so many parts of the story into one beautiful interior. The perspective is both really cool and helps lead our eye wandering up and down the piece, top notch.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - Everything works together really nicely and I love the overall rendering and style. My nitpicky comments are minor but still there, one being that his face isn't very readable, especially not when we're looking at the whole piece at once.  Your rendering is beautiful but changing it up sometimes would help you, for example using softer rounder shapes on the curtains and maybe the water too, I think this would help sell the materials better. I also feel like the contrast overall could be pushed a bit more, making the outside a bit darker and emphasising the candles, lanterns and gnats as light sources, I just think pushing that a little more would help it feel more magical. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 5 - Such a clear idea and executed really well, this could be a book cover or poster and I would want it on my wall. Very adventurous to do such a vertical and interior design too, well done for going for it. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - No issues with the medium at all, my suggestions about using different shapes or brushes for different materials is more a preference than a lack of ability I think.</p>

        <p> A delightful concept, and perfect example of working with tight restrictions rather than against them. The narow value range is pushed competently with deliberation to convey a quaint style and mood, but a few spots of darker value could have been employed more effectively to enforce the PoI. More clearly defined cast shadows, for example.

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - The idea of the coiling smoke is a nice one, but it could have been done much better. Right now the blue light isn't much brighter than the smoke, and I think his hair is brighter still. The background is so much darker, and this high contrast makes things harder to read. I also think the smoke could have been a good way to lead the eye or frame the piece, but it's a bit overwhelming and is this same thick wall for most of the piece. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The face is nice, the hand even nicer, but the rest brings things down overall. The smoke all being this same thickness and bright saturated colour makes it very flat. It's also very close to the colour and values of his hair and the light source itself, so that they are almost lost next to it. I think values are the biggest issue here, but better rendering of the smoke even slightly would help a lot, the other figure feels very unfinished too. I've seen some of your other work and know you can render well if given enough time. I also recommend patience. If you want to "go home early" you won't be able to show your ideas potential properly. I hope you can pace things better for the next prompt. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - The idea is good and I like the idea of making use of the smoke rather than having it just a background feature of the overall piece. The strong lighting is very ambitious too, it's just a shame it didn't work out so well. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your use of the medium is fine, more texture especially exploring the difference materials of hair vs smoke for example would be great, but most issues with this piece are down to fundamentals like values and colour I think, not the way you paint. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - I feel sorry because theres no getting around the comparison to Peltingfury's submission. so ill be brief. its a decent enough composition, but your lighting needed to be more restrained. The blue light in the soldiers hand is barely noticeable. either the blue light needed to be moved away from the smoke, or it needed something else to seperate itself from its surroundings, because being a light, it illuminates its surroundings with the same color it emits. thats pretty obvious, strong lightsources like this create readability issues if not handled correctly. on the positive side of things, your dwarf design is better than peltigns, much cuter :)</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 -  The light can be one color, but its fine if it projects a slightly duller color so long as the light source remains distinct. Pelting did this to great effect. actually, you should just look at his submission because theres basically nothing i can say that you wouldnt be able to glean for yourself by studying his submission.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - the way the smoke is used to hide the dwarf is good, and i cant fault you for the ambitious lighting, you just needed to seperate the lightsource from whatever its illuminating.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - Focus more on the plane changes when doing shading/highlights. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - I really like the idea of this piece, showing different aspects and times of the story all together like this is great. The scale in particular is nice, having the small people on the giant teapot is something that I feel like would sell well to people looking to buy a fairy tale. It has that comfortable but surreal aspect overall I guess.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - A lot of work and thought clearly went into this which is great, and well done for being so ambitious with the idea. Some things that I think would help would be more value planning- things are a bit washed out overall right now, and some more attention to making everything have form to it. The rendering of the clouds and tree right now make them feel quite flat, especially when compared to very nicely formed objects like the teapot and the land the bench is on. The old couple are lovely and I really like the feeling I get from them, but the girl on the teapot could use some more work, her left arm for example feels too long and thin. I think some more colour variation would help too, on the teapot, grass and the leaves. You had some of this in your thumbnail stage, but maybe were less adventurous for the finished piece which is a shame. Don't be afraid to make bold decisions, you can always tone them down later especially if you've kept them to different layers. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 5 - The idea and planning behind this piece are fantastic, and the warm feeling I get from it is really great. There also feels like there's a lot of story to it, even though I'm not familiar with the source. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your use of the medium has no problems, I think you could experiment with things like brush type and texture in future though, they can make painting things like foliage or clouds much faster and easier. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - An ambitious, if simple composition. The idea in question is extremely solid, but is hampered by a strict adherence to the rules of perspective when it would have been better to ignore them in service of a more stylised presentation, akin to Art Nouveau or Art Deco. If there is anything to be changed in this composition, i would elect to either; remove/de-ehphamsize the clouds, or change background to a darker, more saturated color as the pale blues and grey's blend in with the petals creating an unnecesary amount of visual noise in an otherwise strong composition. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The story telling expressed in the composition alone is probably this pieces greatest strength. The 3 tiers of story telling here is something i wouldnt have thought of personally, and that must be commended. however, it is clear that there is work to be done in many areas. The proportions of the characters and anatomy in general are you biggest sumbling points here. The old womans legs are drastically different sizes, everyones heads are just a bit too large, and the Dryad in particular looks a bit more emancipated than i assume you intended. That being said the colour choices, while simple, definitely play to the strengths of the piece and contribute to the almost calm whimsy that it captures.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - As mentioned before, the story telling and concept of the composition are extremely strong. But thats just the idea. The attempt was extremely admirable, but it is clear that this was far out of the scope of your current skillset. Regardless of your current skillset, the your intention behind various design decisions is clear, and the picture is better for it, but it does feel like your idea was held back by your lack of experience  with art.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - Im giving you a 0 on this mostly because it is clear that you are fairly new to digital art. you are familiar with some aspects of your chosen program, but dont understand others. You also seem to be similarly unfamiliar with the dynamics of digital painting which led to an clearly rushed product in a few aspects such as the trees leaves and clothing highlights. You shouldnt be discouraged by this fact however, this is an issue that isn't easily solved and takes time to overcome. The technical aspects of drawing and painting are long standing issues that will continue to be part of your struggle as an artist for life. everyone goes through it. dont worry. its normal. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Very ambitious design, while there's a lot going on it just makes me want to look longer and discover things I hadn't noticed. The perspective and things coming up towards the camera make it feel more magical somehow too, like it's a dream. I think the lighting and values could be more figured out though, at the moment everything is quite light and that makes the glowing effects not as striking, and makes some forms feel a bit flatter too.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The perspective here with things floating or at weird angles is crazy, great job on that. I think the rats and things like fur textures could be better, as well as overall values/contrast like I said before. The main character is great though, and even with the glowing effects being more muted things still feel magical in a happy way, I feel like children would love this.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 5 - I read the story quickly for this and it seemed pretty basic, this piece makes it more dreamlike and adds a lot in my opinion. It feels more like something that could be animated and be loved by kids. Really great feeling to it too.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You used your tools well, I would suggest thinking about edges a little more though, they would really help with things like fur texture and making sparkling light effects. For the effects, playing with layer modes could be useful too. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - The idea is good and feels like a poster, but I feel like the scaling is slightly off. There should be more focus on the MC, even the dog and monkeys heads are a similar size to him right now. Different values might help with this too, to push them further into the background and bring him forward. Right now they all feel quite close in terms of depth which makes him feel smaller and less important. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - Some details are really nice, like the muscles on the red guy, or the hair on the monkey's face. More attention to the main character would be good though, our eyes should go to him first, and right now he's not rendered up much or has any kind of lighting/shading. The other characters have thicker outlines than him too which also works against the balance of things. The colours are ok, but the dog, monkey, red guy's skirt and background are all quite close in value and colour. Don't be afraid to change things to make sure that it reads better overall, it's one of the most important things with a full piece like this. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - The character designs and overall poster like design are nice, I feel like you could have done more with the animals though and maybe with the background, using it to help frame things or give us some depth. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - You've used the medium quite well, especially since we see you sticking to lines or black and white stuff a lot and this is fully painted. I think using lineweights a bit better would help you, having such thick black lines on the animals and red guy just distract the eye away from the thinner stuff on the main guy. </p>

        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - Your anatomy and general fundamentals are mostly strong, but you linework is pretty bad. You could easily Get more points if your lines were just cleaner. The Colors and shading are also a bit weak as well. the color choices by themself are fine, but what little blending/shading does occur is pretty weak. its clear you understand the idea behind the concept of highlights and shadows, but their application is just sloppy. you art is mostly carried by your anatomical knowledge.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - momotaro does line up pretty well with shonen type story telling, doesnt it? </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Design is straightforward but nicely done, I expecially like things like making the background blue a gradient from pale to darker, I think it helps with the depth, or how you kept detailing on the trees and ground minimal so it doesnt distract from all the detail in the roses. I think the snow on the branches could be done differently, I thought there were clouds at first glance, and the focal point is a bit close to the bottom of the canvas, but thats nitpicky of me.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - You've got great attention to making sure details don't compete with each other, and use these and the colours to frame the focal point nicely. I think there could be more variety to the rose bush itself, maybe having some coming towards us or in front of the woman, but it works ok like this. Great job with it being trad, and how you managed to have different values in the trees as they get further away from us, things like that really help. Maybe different lineweight is something to consider in future, the two trees closest to us might work better with a slightly thicker outline for example. I also think you could afford to go darker on the woman's hair, and maybe the outline of the roses too; you don't want to go too dark but having the focus of the piece have the most contrast helps draw the eye there instantly. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 - It's a simple piece but very nicely done, and the feeling from it is really nice. Atmosphere is another way to put it. Some more thought into the trees might have been cool, branches are a good way to lead the eye back down towards the woman too. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - You did great to do this with traditional media and have a solid grasp of it. </p>

        <p> The artist exhibits a solid grasp on the medium. Good work with colors to indicate atmospheric perspective, but a somewhat heavy-handed wash knocks out some of that depth. The foilage seemingly lacks other color. There's some delicate attention put into indicating form and texture, but it could stand some more (unless a flatter aesthetic).

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - the composition is good, but its not very fleshed out. gaps in the tree tops should be reducing as they encraoch upon the horizon (assuming they remain at the same density) and while the color choices are good, the color transition from the top of the trees to their base is mucky, and it doesnt really seem intentnional.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - The general design and color choices are good, but the mother is a bit unpolished, with most of her features being facsimiles of what they really should be. However the main focus wasnt her, it was the enviroment and the color work so that can be forgiven. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - The mothers pose and how she is being embraced by the rose bush is neat. its probably the best way to summarise the story without embelishing it with too many details. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Your color transitions arent great, but i dont doubt you will figure out how to make them more seemless in time.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 5 - Feels very much a fairy tale, and like a key moment in a story. The use of foliage is really nice, the tree closest to us on the left especially helps with the overall depth of things. Some parts feel a little flat or unfinished, like between the back of the prince's cloak and the furthest right tree trunk, or the bridge, but overall this piece is lovely and manages to have so much detail in it without it being overwhelming or distracting from the central scene.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 4 - Everything works very well together, though there are some things whch I'm not so sure on. The bridge in the background feels like a placeholder, and some of the lilypads have different perspectives, though maybe this is to show them bobbing around on waves? I think some of your value choices are too close to each other; the frogs on the lilypads blend into their backgrounds, especially the ones nearer the bridge. Some more rendering of the light on the characters would be nice too, something to show the metal of the prince's crown, or some shadow to the girl's hair to give her head some more shape, it feels a bit flat at the moment. Very good job balancing all the detail going on in this piece though, and all the colours and values hold togther really nicely. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The character designs and really nice and I like it being an action shot, it feels like an important part of a story where one character starts to fall for another. Very classic Disney. The garden is lush and great to look at, and I liked finding the frogs when I hadn't noticed them before. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - You've made good use of the tools you have, I can see some different shading techniques to help with more gradual colour or value transitions. It all works well and must have taken a long time, great job getting all this done in such a short time. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - The piece is extremely well balanced in most respects. The colors all pop but dont detract from the central focus, everything leads to the central figures extremely naturally, and everything just works. my only really complaint about the composition itself is that the rim lighting is very weak on your central characters. There was a missed opportunity to really make your core elements elements stand out even more with a stronger focus on the lighting. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - This is a bit hard to place because some elements are so strong that they would normally constitute a 4 or even a 5/5 score, but other elements are comparitevely lackluster, to point where im unsure why they were included. the Color choices in general are fantastic , theres no denying that, however the application of Rim lighting and and value transitions leaves something to be desired. your choice in flats are so strong that it compensates for the comparitive lack of complexity in other areas and i genuinely wonder why you dont just forgo blending colours in favour of really leaning into those flats with some strong cellshading sometimes. Another aspect that needs to be mentioned is the linework, or the lack of it. Most of the linework is well placed and serves it function well, but some of it, namely on the frog prince's snout and clothing, feels unnecesary. i dont know if it was because of the tight deadline or you genuinely just forgot, but there are errant lines all over the frog prince that stand out on close inspection. the reason i bring it up is mostly that these errant lines are almost exclusively limited to the frog prince, and arent anywhere to be seen on the rest of the piece. this is a nitpick at best, but it had to be mentioned. also the frog prince looks more like a gecko with that long snout.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Despite the idea itself not being too original its a fully realised piece of work, and being one of the few romantically oriented pieces is something to appreicate too. Though i must confess, i dont understand why you want to fuck the frog.  </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - aside from some rough color blending in places there isnt much to talk about.  </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em>2 - It tells some good story and I like the feeling of us being comfortable inside while the wolf shouts from outside. I feel like there should be more emphasis placed on the two pigs nearest to us though, they shouldnt be quite as cropped off as they are and could do with being a different value to bring them forward out of their surroundings. Darkening the back wall would also help with this. And while I love the /ic/ pig, he has as much space given to him as the other people in the scene which makes me unsure if he's the focal point or if the wolf or other pigs are.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em>2 - There's some really nice details, like the fur on the wolf's face, a lot of the rest is left pretty bare though. Some shadows on the furniture would help give them some more perspective and make it feel more like a 3D scene, and the pigs closest to us could do with some more detailing too since they're nearer to us than the ic pig. Thinking about perspective more would be good too, I think we would see more of the top of the table between the two pigs from this angle and seeing that and the items on top of it would help sell the perspective more too. More colour variation would be nice too, even simple things like how pigs are more reddish around the ears and nose, and paler on most of the rest of the face. There's some of this there but you've changed more the value and not the hue or saturation as much, don't be afraid to try things out on a different layer and then tone them down as needed. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - I've never seen this story like this in my life. More details of the room and items in it would be great, and some more design to the characters to make the pigs more different, but the idea itself is great and ofc topical. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - I'd like to see more experimenting with different brushes and ways of implying texture and form like you did with the wolf's face. Using different edges or having gradients of different colour could really help with things like the pigs fleshy bodies, and you can do that in different ways, it doesnt have to all be brushed in manually. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - the composition is functional, if a bit bland. The colour scheme is extremey drab and honestly a bit uninstersting to look at. The Floor really shouldnt have been the same color as the walls, but its mostly in service of creating a depressing atmosphere, and on that front it succeeds. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 2 - The fur from the instanity wolf is well the most impressive part of this, its just a very economical use of brush work to get a good effect. I also like the wolfs pose, however a little bit of refinement could have gone a long way to making him properly imposing or impish, depending on where you wanted to go with it. as it stands right now, it feels like hes caught in a weird middle ground between the two, but its still good.. The pigs arefunctional, but very basic. They dont really expresses any real level of competence beyond the bare minimum of anatomical knowledge and some good painting skill, and the same goes for the enviroment too.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - the landlord insanity-wolf combo is an interesting take on the character, and im surprised you didnt go for the low hanging fruit of pigs as captialist's which, noting the presence of the king of landlord removal, you probably would have if you werent constrained by the topic at hand. you also did a good job of integrating current events in a way thats not super heavy handed, so that needs to be commended. that being said, </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - this is a bit of a strange situation, because you arent really limited by your program of choice, more just by your own habits. Things like the pigs hand an the general structure of the the objects in the evniroment are evidence enough for that. you know how to paint, but you dont know how to draw, and you are using painting as a crutch. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Strong graphic design, I really like you using the lighting as a tool not just as the focal point. Its really selling the forms of the rest of the piece too. I'm not sure about it being pure black at the top as well as the bottom, I feel like you could have the smoke be a gentler transition at either the top or bottom, not have them both like that. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - Very good job on the lighting, the faces underlit by it are top notch. Costume and character design is nice too, I'm not a big fan of the dwarf though, the design or the sharp edges on him. Some difference in edges in general would help this piece, the smoke especially being a mix of hard and very soft would look nicer. Sharp for the underlit faces and then softer as their features recede into the smoke kind of thing. I feel like you could experiment with different colour too, the light and underlit smoky heads should be blue but the soldier himself and his uniform doesnt have to be so similar to these. I understand about the time limitation though and I'm sure it'd look different if you had had time to do more on the soldier. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - The underlit faces and use of the light to show things is really nice and makes the piece imo, it gives things a bit of a spooky vibe too which is nice and fits with the brothers grimm type tales.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Some different use of edges and ways of rendering would help sell the materials better, especially the smoke, and I think you could try out different layer modes too for crazy light sources like this. Linear dodge etc can be powerful tools and save you time too.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 5 - The only thing to be said is that the dwarf's design is just kind of there. it just looks like bald kid with black sclera. it works well for the strange atmosphere of the piece, but it is just a bald kid basically. </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 5 - i just wish you could have cleaned it up more. i dont have anything constructive to tell you i just like it. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 5 - i dont know what to tell you mate. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - its great. teach me. or dont, its up to you. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 3 - Good story to the composition, nice use of lighting from the window and things like the flowy curtains and the gun all lead our eye straight to the focal point. My main issue with the design is that red riding hood doesn't fit quite as well as she might, her values feel pretty strong compared to the other two and I think her perspective is off a bit, like we're above the other two and the chest of drawers etc but low enough to see her skirt and thighs under her coat. She feels a bit large in general too I think, with her head too close to the top of the canvas. Shrinking her or extending the canvas would be an easy fix though and keep the good composition you have.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 - There's really solid fundies on display here, red riding hood aside the perspective all works well, and I really like the wolf, costumes, lighting and so on. I hope you have more time for the next prompt so we can see what you planned to do with colours over the whole piece. I understand some things are rushed, but the idea and fundamentals are solid and I look forward to seeing what you can do when you pace things better.</p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 3 - Seeing the story in a new light is always nice, I'm not sure who's the hero and who's the villain here which is cool too. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 1 - Can't say much to your mastery of tools and methods since it's unfinished, but I think I see some layer modes and mixed kinds of brushes for the lighting, so you know what you're doing mostly. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 4 - Probably the most cinematic composition of the lot. It looks like the closing scene of a action thriller, or the beggining of a revenge plot.  some more color variation in the enviroment would have been nice, but its clearly not finished so i can forgive that.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 3 -  The lighting is nice, and the wolfs pose is good, but the gesture of the other characters is a bit off. it looks like red riding hood is standing on the end of some stairs with how her back foot is elevated, and the grandmothers proportions are somewhat inconsistent. The cast shadows also feel pretty weak despite how harsh the light comoing from the window is. that being said, yeah its clearly unfinished so i want to give you the benefit of the doubt with some of the less aggregious stuff like the shadows. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 4 - Red riding hood being the aggressor, killing her grandmother. it is strange how the wolf is the victim in this scenario, but i guess red riding hood is trying to be more like B.B.Hood. </p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 2 - id like to see what a finished piece from you looks like next time.</p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 2 - There's nice use of the diagonal path, and it adds some depth, automatically adds a little narrative since she's going somewhere. I think you should consider foreground background etc more though, at the moment we just have those trees and they don't feel very well placed in space or compositionally. You should try to frame the character and lead the eye where you want it to go, maybe do more thumbnails for the next one to experiment with different options.</p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - I like some of the attention to detail like the texture of the trees, or her hair and different layers of clothing, but there's a few things that need work. Her anatomy, particularly arms and hands are awkward and not proportional, she doesnt seem entirely placed on the path right, and I cant decide if those are small trees or she's a big girl. The colours overall aren't bad but you should think about values more and how you can use them to both draw attention where you want it to be as well as show what things are in the foreground vs background. I also think some of your detailing would have been better spent on the character than on the path. </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 1 - The character herself is nice but the rest of the piece is pretty sparse. I'm glad you have at least some background, but just having empty space behind the trees and grass is odd, and I think you could put in some more things next time to make the environment more interesting, wthout distracting from the character too much.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - You're not very comfortable with digital yet and I think you're thinking more in terms of drawing everything in different colours rather than painting them if that makes sense. Don't be afraid to use bigger brushes, especially for the environment stuff, and try out implying things. Drawing every outline isnt always necessary, you can show so much with some shadow shapes to describe forms. </p>

        <p><em>Composition and Design:</em> 1 - I dont really understand whats going on in this. The girl is drawn in one perspective, and the ground is being drawn in a completely other, isometric persepctive. Its really strange because  </p>
        <p><em>Application of other Artistic Fundamentals:</em> 1 - The anatomy is very inconsistent, with different parts being disproportionately long or short, mostly at radnom. the perspective is odd and confusing, and the hatching is 'misplaced' to put it charitably. Hatching is its own topic and i could go into great deatil about it, but the short version is that your hatching needs to vary a lot more. hatching can be used to indicate shadows and texture. if the hatching is all the same, theres no point in having it at all. In this particular instance, it looks like you were so distracted by the hatching that you forgot to do much of anything else. It was certainly ambitious of you to do so much hatching, and i cant fault you for that.  </p>
        <p><em>Creativity and Originality:</em> 2 -  Despite how much i ragged on about the hatching, it wasnt a bad idea. Its just that you focused so much on hatching  and spent so long on it, when really you should have used that time to cleaning up the rest of your drawing.</p>
        <p><em>Materials and Media:</em> 0 - I think what you need to work on most, despite how harsh i was being, is just your priorities. Focus more on the structure of your drawing first before doing fine details, and i dont doubt we'll see imrpovement in the future </p>
